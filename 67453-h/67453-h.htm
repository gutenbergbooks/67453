of the Distemper.&mdash;Of the Plagues mentioned in the Old
Testament.&mdash;History of several remarkable Plagues which,
at various times, have desolated the world.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">A<span class="ls01em">MONG</span> the many diseases which afflict the human
race, we find <span class="lowercase smcap">ONE</span>, upon record, so irresistible
in its progress, so fatal in its attacks, and so
entirely beyond the powers of medicine; that, like the
serpent <i>Python</i>, the <i>Leviathan</i>, or the <i>Mammoth</i>, among
animals, it has generally been distinguished by names
expressive of its destroying nature; not, like other diseases,
by any particular appellation derived from its
symptoms. In the Hebrew language this distemper is
expressed by the word which signifies <i>perdition</i><span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Greek it is called <i>loimos</i>, from <i>luo</i>, to destroy; in Latin,
<i>pestis</i>, from <i>pessundo</i>, to overthrow; and in English, the
<i>plague</i>, from the Latin <i>plaga</i>, a stroke with a whip;
alluding to the common opinion, that it is a scourge
from heaven, taking vengeance on mankind for their
sins.</p>

<p>Other distempers, called by the general name of
<i>Epidemics</i>, have at different times infected whole cities,
and even overspread extensive regions; but these,
though sometimes very fatal, have always been found
so much inferior to the distemper of which we treat,
that, on a comparison, we may justly say, though epidemics
have slain their <i>thousands</i>, the true plague has
slain its <i>ten thousands</i>. In speaking of the destructive
ravages of epidemics, we may count the dead by tens,
by hundreds, or by thousands; but in the true plague,
always by thousands, by myriads<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> or by millions.
Procopius, when speaking of a plague which desolated
the world in his time, compares the number of the dead
to the sand of the sea; and Mr. Gibbon, who attempts
to specify, thinks they might amount to an hundred
millions<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> and I cannot help being of opinion,
that the destruction generally occasioned by violent
plagues, amounts to about one half of the population;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the reasons for which opinion will be given in the
course of this work. In all violent plagues, we hear of
the dead being left unburied; of their being cast into
pits, &amp;c. But if we wish to make any gross comparison
between the destructive power of the true plague,
and that of any other violent epidemic, we cannot,
perhaps, have a better instance than that which took
place at Bassorah (a city on the confines of Persia) in
the years 1773 and 1780<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> In the former of these
years that city was visited by the true plague; and in
the latter, by an epidemic remittent fever. The fever
was most violent in its kind, and destroyed twenty-five
thousand in the city and neighbourhood; but the true
plague, no fewer than two hundred and seventy-five
thousand in the same place. Supposing the two computations
therefore to be equally exact, we must calculate
this plague to have been eleven times more deadly
than the epidemic. If therefore the ingenious classifiers,
in modern times, have brought into alliance the plague
with other epidemic diseases, and characterised the former
from the latter; we may justly say, that they have fallen
into the same error with other naturalists, who
characterise the superior from the inferior; the lion
from the cat, not the cat from the lion. As to the
remedies applied in these diseases, doubtful in epidemics,
they so universally fail in the true plague, that,
notwithstanding the improved state of medicine, we
may yet say, it stands among diseases, in a great measure,
like a giant without any champion to oppose; like
a poison without any antidote.</p>

<p>In this unhappy predicament, the breaking out of
a plague, in any city or country, proves a most
distressing calamity, not only on account of the numbers
destroyed by the disease itself, but by reason of
the bonds of society being loosed; so that humanity
gives way to terror; children are abandoned by
their parents, and parents by their children; every
thing wears the appearance of ruin and desolation;
while, in too many instances, avarice urges on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
unprincipled to rapine, or even to murder. Nor
are the cruel modes of prevention, sometimes practiced
even by the authority of the magistrate, less
abhorrent to humanity, then the lawless outrages
of the thief or murderer. Instances of all this will
appear in the course of the work; the following are
so remarkable, that I cannot help inserting them in
this place. In the great plague at Marseilles, in 1720,
the town being almost deserted, and few choosing to
venture into it, “three sea-captains, and some hundreds
of sailors, having the courage to enter the city, from
the sea-side, found therein a gang of murderers, who
made it their business to destroy people seized with the
plague, and to plunder their houses. The ringleader
of them, named <i>Rouanne</i>, a gunsmith, was broken alive
upon the wheel, and forty others were hanged. Rouanne
owned that he had killed a thousand persons.
There were found, upon one of the murderers, jewels
to the value of more than thirty thousand livres.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>
During the time of this public calamity, four men, who
came from Marseilles to Aix, were shot by order of
the parliament, lest they should have brought the infection
along with them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> Even this is not equal to what
Mr. Howard informs us was practiced in a hamlet of
Dalmatia, where, the plague having raged with such
violence, that only two or three remained; the neighbouring
magistrates ordered these miserable survivors to
be shot. At such prices will people buy a precarious,
nay, an imaginary, safety. In short, what Mr. Gibbon
says of the situation of people in the time of violent
earthquakes, will also, in a great measure, hold good
in the time of pestilence, or any great public calamity.
“Instead of the mutual sympathy which might comfort
and assist the distressed, they dreadfully experience
the vices and passions which are released from a fear
of punishment; the houses are pillaged by intrepid
avarice, revenge embraces the moment and selects
the victim: while <span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>vengeance</span> frequently overtakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the assassin or ravisher in the consummation of his
crimes.”</p>

<p>Whether the world hath been in the same predicament
ever since the human race began to multiply, or whether
plagues have originated at some remote period,
is a question not easily determined. It is certain that,
as far as histories go, they give us accounts of plagues;
much less frequent indeed in very ancient times than in
those which followed; but the compass of historical
knowledge is narrow. There are no authentic histories
of any nation previous to the termination of those of
the Old Testament. Where sacred history ends, profane
history begins. The fabulous period affords many
accounts of wars, heroes, giants, and monsters, but
scarce any of plagues. Diodorus Siculus indeed makes
mention of a plague which happened in Greece, after
the flood of Deucalion; and which, he says, was occasioned
by the general corruption of vegetables, &amp;c.
consequent on the flood. Deucalion’s flood is supposed
to have been nearly cotemporary with the departure
of the Israelites from Egypt; so that, if there is
any truth in the relation of Diodorus, it is not improbable
that some of the Egyptian plagues might have
spread into Greece. We are likewise told of a pestilence
at Athens in the time of Theseus<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> but all the
accounts of these times are so uncertain, and so much
involved in fable, that little or no dependence can be
placed on any of them.</p>

<p>The first distinct account we have of plagues of any
kind, then, is in the book of Exodus, where we are
told of many heavy judgments sent upon the Egyptians
because of their disobedience. Before this, indeed, we
read of plagues sent on the king of Egypt, for having
taken Abraham’s wife; but as these fell only upon the
king and his household, we cannot suppose any thing
like a general pestilence to have taken place among the
people. In like manner did it happen to Abimelech,
king of Gerar, on the same account. All the women
belonging to the king’s household were rendered barren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
for a time; but we hear of nothing happening to the
nation at large. Again, when Moses and Aaron went
in before Pharaoh, they said to him, “Let us go and
sacrifice to the Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with
the sword, or with <i>pestilence</i>.” This shews indeed that
both Moses and Pharaoh knew that such a thing as
<i>pestilence</i> existed, or might exist; but it cannot prove
that the disease we now call the plague or pestilence
commonly took place among nations in those days as
it has done since. Even among the plagues inflicted
upon the Egyptians by the hand of Moses and Aaron,
we find only two that can be supposed to have any
similarity to the disease we now call the <i>plague</i>; viz. the
<i>boil</i>, and the destruction of their first born. The former
<i>may</i> have been pestilential buboes; the latter also <i>may</i>
have been the effect of a most malignant pestilence;
such as, in the beginning of it, is said frequently to kill
suddenly, as by lightning; but whether it was so or not,
we cannot now determine.</p>

<p>In the history of Job, who is supposed to have been
cotemporary with Moses, we have a case more in point.
The boils, with which he was covered, are by Dr. Mead
supposed to have been the small pox; though in the
true plague the body is sometimes covered with gangrenous
pustules, constituting a disease still more dangerous
and painful than the small pox; but whatever the
disease of Job was, we may reasonably conclude, that in
his time there was none similar to it commonly existing
among mankind.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, we
find frequent mention of a plague as a disease commonly
to be met with; but it was always that of leprosy;
those destructive plagues, which might be supposed to
resemble the disease we now call by that name, being all
miraculous. Concerning the prevalence of the leprosy
among the Jews, Diodorus says that they “were driven
out of Egypt as impious, and hateful to the gods; for
their bodies being overspread and infected with the
itch and leprosy, (by way of expiation) they got them
together, and, as profane and wicked wretches, expelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
them out of their coasts.” This he tells us was a reason
given to one of the kings of Syria why he should exterminate
the Jews. In another place our author gives
the following account of the origin of the Jewish nation.
“In ancient times there happened a great plague in Egypt,
and many ascribed the cause of it to God, who
was offended with them. For there being multitudes
of strangers of several nations who inhabited there, who
used foreign ceremonies, the ancient manner of worship
was quite lost and forgotten. Hence the natural
inhabitants concluded, that unless the strangers were
driven out, they should never be freed from their
miseries. Upon which they were all expelled,” &amp;c.
He then tells us that some of them came into Greece
under the conduct of Danaus and Cadmus; but the
greater part entered Judea, then quite desert and uninhabited.
Their leader “was one <i>Moses</i>, a very wise
and valiant man,” &amp;c<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>The allusion, in this last passage of Diodorus, to the
plagues of Egypt, mentioned in Exodus, is manifest;
and it is equally manifest, that the Egyptians themselves,
as well as the sacred historian, owned them to be
miraculous. Here, however, let it be remarked, that,
though these, and others inflicted on the Israelites, were
miraculous, we are not from thence to conclude that
they took place without the intervention of natural
causes. On the contrary, in speaking of the plagues of
Egypt, we are told, that when the locusts came, “the
Lord sent a strong <i>east wind</i>, all that day and all that
night; and when it was morning, the <i>east wind</i>
brought the locusts.” In like manner “the Lord
turned a mighty strong <i>west wind</i>, which took away
the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea.” Again,
when the sea itself was divided, “the Lord caused it to
go back by a strong <i>east wind</i> all that night.” The
Egyptians were witnesses to this; but, as they did not
believe that the powers of nature had any superior, they
could never be induced to think that any of the
elements would take part in a dispute between two
nations, or favour the one more than the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>In diseases inflicted on the human body, we are
assured that the powers of nature were as much employed
as in the miracles already mentioned. When it was
told David that the child born to him by Bathsheba
should die, the infant was seized with a natural distemper,
probably a fever, and died the seventh day. When
Hezekiah was informed that he should die, he did not,
any more than David had done, give himself up to
despair; but used, for his recovery, such means as were
in his power, viz. prayers to God; from whom, by the
constitution of things under the Old Testament, he
would receive a direct answer. And it is remarkable,
that though the answer was favourable, yet the disease
was not removed by any invisible power operating like
a charm, but by the use of a remedy. It is plain therefore
that this disease was occasioned by one natural
power, and removed by another. The boil (for that
was the distemper) was brought to maturity by a poultice
of figs, and the king recovered<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> If then the
scripture informs us, that even where the Deity himself
speaks, he has directed the use of a remedy, much more
ought we to be diligent in the use of such as our feeble
skill can suggest, in those cases where he leaves us entirely
to the exercise of our own judgments. To sit
down supinely, in case of a dangerous distemper, with a
notion, that if God wills us to die we certainly shall die,
<i>in any use of natural means</i>; and if he wills the contrary,
that we shall as certainly recover, <i>in any neglect of them</i>;
is a conduct equally unscriptural and absurd.</p>

<p>In the books of Moses we find the Israelites,
in case of disobedience, threatened with the <i>botch</i> of
Egypt; with terror, consumption, and the <i>burning ague</i>.
From the name of this last we may reasonably suppose
it to have been the same with the remitting fever of
the East, which is attended with the most intolerable
sensation of burning in the bowels; but whatever the
nature of these diseases might have been, they certainly
were not very common in the world at that time, or
they would not have been threatened as extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
judgments. They were not the same with the pestilence;
because we find, that after they had been threatened
with fever, consumption, and extreme burning,
it is added, “I will make the <i>pestilence</i> cleave unto
thee:” as if it had been said, that the pestilence, which
hitherto had appeared only on extraordinary occasions,
should then become <i>endemic</i>, and never leave them. But,
on the whole, the first account we have of any general
plague, seems to be that which was inflicted on the
Jews on account of the sin of their king in numbering
the people. David was nearly cotemporary with the
Trojan war; and Homer, in the first book of his Iliad,
informs us, that a plague likewise took place in the
camp of the Greeks; and that too for the sin of their
king in carrying off the daughter of the priest of Apollo,
and refusing to restore her at the entreaty of her
father.</p>

<p>In comparing the account of the sacred historian
with that given by Homer, we cannot help observing a
striking similarity between them. Both plagues were
inflicted on the people for the sin of their kings; both
were miraculous; the one continued three days, the
other nine. In both the Deity himself appeared: an
angel brandished a drawn sword over Jerusalem; and
Homer says, that, from the top of Olympus, Apollo
shot his arrows into the Grecian camp. Lastly, both
were stopped in a similar manner: David offered sacrifices
to the true God; and Agamemnon returned
Chryseis, his captive, to her father, the priest of Apollo,
by whose prayers and sacrifices the plague was stopped.
Hence it seems not impossible, that the story told by
Homer, is only that of David, altered as he thought
most proper for embellishing his poem; and that this
was the first remarkable plague in the world.</p>

<p>In the year 767 B.&nbsp;C. we hear of a universal pestilence;
but the imperfect state of history in those early
periods affords few accounts that can be depended
upon, either concerning that or any thing else<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> Till
after the foundation of Rome, indeed, authentic history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
scarce commences; and it is not till the 279th year of
that city, that we hear of its being in any remarkable
degree infected with a pestilential disorder<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> The plague
we speak of is said to have taken place about the year
469 B.&nbsp;C. which comes within 38 years of that of
Athens in the time of the Peloponnesian war. The
near coincidence of these dates, in times so remote, and
when chronology was so little settled, tends to excite a
suspicion that both arose from the same infection. Of
its ravages at Athens we have an excellent account by
the historian Thucydides<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> who was an eye witness of
what he writes. He says, that according to report it
began in Ethiopia, from whence it came down into
Egypt, and thence into other countries. It is possible,
therefore, that it might reach Italy some time before it
came into Greece; for it seems scarce probable, that
such a very violent infection could have taken place in
Italy without being communicated to the neighbouring
countries; whence we may reasonably conclude, that
the first plague at Rome, and that of Thucydides, were
the same. At Rome, we are informed, it swept away
almost all the flower of the youth who were able to
bear arms, the greatest part of the tribunes, and both
the consuls. The mortality was so great, that no place
of sepulture could be found for the dead bodies, but
they were thrown promiscuously into the Tiber. In
short, so low were the Romans at this time reduced,
that the Æqui and Volsci, two Italian nations with
whom they were almost always at war, made an immediate
attack, in hopes of being easily able to carry the
city; but in this they were disappointed. The situation
of Athens was truly deplorable; being not only
engaged in a foreign war, but crowded with people from
the country; numbers dying daily in the streets, and
the survivors giving themselves up to all manner of
licentiousness<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>As it seems probable that the same infection desolated
both Rome and Athens, so it seems not unlikely
that it was a continuance of the same which destroyed
the Carthaginian army in Sicily, while carrying on a
successful war against Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse.
The plague, as we are informed by the Universal History,
was common in the Carthaginian territories, especially
those on the continent of Africa; and this pestilence
broke out soon after the conclusion of the Peloponnesian
war. As it originally came from Africa, it is
probable that it had never been quite extinguished
there; and the compilers of the Universal History
think it probable that the army might have brought
the seeds of it along with them into Sicily. But, whatever
was the origin, the distemper soon became so
malignant, that the living were not sufficient to bury
the dead; and those who attended the sick perished in
such a manner, that, after some time, few dared to
come near them. At first they gave the dead a kind
of burial; but in time the number became so great,
and the survivors so few and weak, that an hundred and
fifty thousand are said to have rotted above ground.
“Justin seems to intimate that almost the whole Carthaginian
army perished by the plague; and that in
a manner all at once, as it were in an instant. Diodorus,
however, informs us, that a considerable body
of Africans and Iberians survived the dreadful calamity.
It is worth observation, that not a single person
of those who attended the sick survived.” The miserable
remains of this army, consisting at first of more
than three hundred thousand, were now attacked by
their enemies, whom they were no longer able to resist.
Their land forces were entirely defeated, and their fleet
was burnt: “the Gods themselves, (says Diodorus)
when the ships were all in a blaze, and the flames
ascending above the masts, seeming to destroy the
Carthaginians with lightning from heaven.” Forty
gallies still remained, and the unfortunate general was
now obliged to purchase liberty to return with the few
men he had left. But even these were treacherously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
attacked by the tyrant’s fleet, and several of them sunk.
On his arrival at Carthage, he found the whole city not
only in mourning, but in despair: “the wretched inhabitants
giving full vent to their grief, made the
shore ring with their groans and lamentations. In
short, a greater scene of horror, except the spot of
ground where the Carthaginian army encamped before
Syracuse, than Carthage now was, cannot well be
conceived.” This reception completed the despair
of the unhappy general. Clothing himself in mean and
sordid attire, he joined with the rest in bewailing their
common calamities. After some desperate exclamations
against the gods, whom he accused of partiality,
“The enemy, said he, may rejoice at our misery, but
have no reason to glory in it. The troops we have
lost did not fall by their valour, nor did they now
oblige those that arrived here to leave Sicily by force.
We return victorious over the Syracusians, and are
only defeated by the plague. As for the baggage
found in our camp, this ought not to be looked upon
as the spoils of a conquered enemy, but as moveables
which the casual death of their owners has left the
Syracusians in possession of.” Having then gone on
to express his grief for the loss of his army, and declared
his intention not to outlive them, he shut himself up
in his house, refusing admittance even to his own children,
and put an end to his life<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the unfortunate remains of this army
brought with them the infection to Carthage, and there
produced a new scene of desolation, we are not informed;
but there seems to have been a very great tendency
to pestilential disorders in the Carthaginian armies;
for, in the time of the siege of Syracuse by Marcellus,
a plague broke out in the camp of the Carthaginians
who had come to assist the Syracusians. From them it
passed into the city itself, with so much malignity, that
nothing was to be seen but heaps of dead and dying.
None durst receive or assist the sick, for fear of being
infected by them; and the bodies of the dead were, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
the same reason, left unburied, to infect and poison the
air with their putridity and corruption. Nothing was
heard, night and day, but groans of dying men; and
the heaps of dead bodies continually presented mournful
objects to the living, who expected every moment
the same fate<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> The infection reached the Roman
camp; but we do not hear of its being conveyed, at
this time, either to Rome or Carthage. In the time of
the contest with Jugurtha, however, a very terrible calamity
took place in Africa. “According to Orosius,
a great part of Africa was covered with locusts, which
destroyed all the produce of the earth, and even devoured
dry wood. But, at last, they were all carried by the
wind into the sea, out of which being thrown in vast
heaps upon the shore, a plague ensued, which swept
away an infinite number of animals of all kinds. In
Numidia only, perished eight hundred thousand men;
and in Africa Propria, two hundred thousand; among
the rest, thirty thousand Roman soldiers, quartered in
and about Utica for the defence of the last mentioned
province. At Utica, in particular, the plague raged
with such violence, that fifteen hundred dead bodies
were carried out of one gate in a day.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>From the time that the Romans finished their African
wars, till they had accomplished most of their conquests
in Asia, their empire seems to have continued
free from this dreadful scourge; but soon after the
destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, such a violent infection
seized on the city, that for some time upwards of
twenty thousand are said to have died in it daily.</p>

<p>As the Roman arms were carried still farther to the
eastward, and all the countries reduced, to the confines
of Persia, the plague seems to have become more common
among them. In the time of Marcus Aurelius, a
war was undertaken against the Parthians, which was
carried on by the Romans with great success, and with
no less cruelty; for, though the city of Seleucia opened
its gates to the Roman general, he caused the inhabitants,
to the number of four hundred thousand, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
massacred. But they soon paid dear for this cruelty,
by a dreadful pestilence, which broke out, according
to the historian Ammianus Marcellinus, in the very
city which they had desolated, and was brought by
their army into Italy, from whence it spread throughout
the whole empire. Other historians say, that it
originated in Ethiopia, from whence it spread into
Egypt, and thence into the country of the Parthians.
We know not how long the infection continued; only
that, some years afterwards, when the emperor was
defeated by the Germans, the pestilence still raged to
such a degree, that slaves, gladiators, and even the banditti
of Dalmatia and Dardania, were enlisted for the
defence of the empire. It is certain that great havock
must have been made by it, as we find that the barbarians
were encouraged to invade the empire on all sides,
and could scarcely be repulsed; insomuch that historians
compare this with the most destructive wars the
Romans had ever waged<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>During the time that the empire was overrun by the
northern barbarians, the plague frequently made its
appearance; which we shall have occasion to notice
more particularly in the following section; but in those
times the destruction by the sword was so extraordinary,
that less mention is made by history of any pestilential
disorder. In the time of Justinian, however, about
sixty-five years after the final destruction of the western
empire, the most violent plague recorded in history took
place. Of this we have a particular account by Procopius<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span>
“The distemper (says Mr. Gibbon) arose in the
neighbourhood of Pelusium, on the confines of Egypt,
between the Sarbonian bog and the eastern channel
of the Nile. From thence, tracing, as it were, a
double path, it spread to the east, over Syria, Persia,
and the Indies, and penetrated to the west, along the
coast of Africa, and over the continent of Europe.
In the spring of the second year, Constantinople, during
three or four months, was visited by this pestilence.
Such was the corruption of the air, that the pestilence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
was not checked, nor alleviated, by any difference
of seasons. The numbers that perished in this
extraordinary mortality have not been recorded; only
we find that, during three months, there died at Constantinople
five, and at last ten thousand a day. Many
cities of the east were left vacant, and, in several districts
of Italy, the harvest and vintage withered on the
ground. The triple scourge of war, pestilence and
famine afflicted the subjects of Justinian; and his
reign is disgraced by a visible decrease of the human
species, which has never been repaired, in some of the
fairest countries of the globe.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>This plague broke out in the time of Justinian, in
the year 541 or 542 of the christian era; and not only
ravaged Constantinople in the time of Justinian, but
returned with increased violence during the reigns of
many of his successors. In the time of Mauritius we
find the Avari, a barbarous nation to the north of the
Danube, driven back by the plague after they had crossed
that river to invade the Roman territories. The
reign of Phocas, successor to Mauritius, was still more
unfortunate. “Great numbers were swept off, either
by famine or pestilence; the earth refused her fruits
in season; the winters were so severe, that the seas
were frozen, and the fish destroyed.” Phocas ascended
the imperial throne in 603; but in the midst of
such confusion as then filled the world, we can scarce
expect an accurate account of the time when this most
malignant pestilence ceased. We can scarcely suppose
it to have lasted two centuries; but, in the reign of
Constantine Copronymus, which began in 742, we find
the distemper still raging, and the same dreadful phenomena
of nature still continuing. The plague, we are
now told, broke out in Calabria in Italy; whence it soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
spread over Greece, Sicily, the islands in the Ægean sea;
and at last reached Constantinople; where it raged for
three years together, with such fury, that the living
were scarce sufficient to bury the dead. The earthquakes,
which accompanied or preceded this pestilence,
were such as had never been known in any age. In Syria
and Palestine several cities were swallowed up;
others, entirely ruined; and some, if we may give credit
to Nicephorus, removed without any considerable damage,
six miles and upwards from their former seats. At
the same time happened an extraordinary darkness, which
lasted from the fourth of August to the first of October,
there being little or no distinction, during all that time,
between day and night<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> During the reign of the same
prince, there happened such an extraordinary frost, that,
at Constantinople, both seas were frozen for an hundred
miles from the shore; the ice being covered with snow
twenty cubits deep, and sufficiently strong to bear the
heaviest carriages. When the frost broke, mountains
of ice and frozen snow, being driven by the wind
through the straits, did a great deal of damage to the walls
of Constantinople. The month following, several prodigies
appeared, or were thought to appear, in the air.
At the same time a comet, which the Greeks called
<i>Docites</i>, because it resembled a beam, was seen for ten
days in the east, from whence it moved into the west,
and shone there for one and twenty days more. The
people were struck with terror and amazement at the
sight of the prodigies, and apprehended the last day to
be at hand<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> Dreadful earthquakes, strange phenomena
in the heavens, inundations, &amp;c. occurred in the
year 812, during the reign of Michael Balbus; but no
remarkable plague is mentioned by the Greek historians,
till the year 1025, when a new train of calamities
took place. The plague broke out in Cappadocia, raging
with such violence there, as well as in Paphlagonia
and Armenia, that the people were forced to abandon
their dwellings. A terrible famine followed; after
which the earthquakes again commenced with redoubled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
fury: at Constantinople they continued forty days
together; while people were terrified by a <i>comet</i> (probably
a large meteor) which passed with a dreadful noise
from north to south; the whole horizon appearing to
be in a flame.</p>

<p>From these calamities the world, at least that part of
it known to the Greek historians, appears to have enjoyed
some respite till the year 1346. Indeed we may
now say, as in the time of the invasion by the northern
barbarians, that the sword, and not the pestilence,
was the plague of those times. A most violent and
universal pestilence, however, now took place; though,
for want of such historians as Thucydides and Procopius,
we cannot here give a particular account of it. In
general we are told, that it began in the kingdom of
Cathay (the northern part of China) from whence it
gradually overspread all the countries between that and
the western extremity of Asia. Invading, at last, Constantinople,
it proceeded from thence to Greece, Italy,
France, Africa, Germany, Hungary, Denmark, Britain
and Ireland. Thus, it seems to have been as extensive
a contagion as ever appeared in the world. It is even
probable, that, from the remains of this contagion,
Europe hath been but very lately set at liberty; as we
hear, not long after, of plagues being very frequent in
different parts of that continent. In England it assumed
somewhat of a new form towards the end of the
fifteenth century; being then known by the name of
the English Sweating Sickness. But, except in the
greater propensity to sweat, the disease appears not to
have differed from the true plague. The sweating sickness
first made its appearance in the army of Henry
VII, when he landed at Milford in 1483; and that
year invaded London, where it continued only from
the 21st of September to the end of October. It
returned in 1485, 1506, 1517, 1528 and 1551; since
which time it has not been known in Britain. In 1517
it was extremely violent and mortal; sometimes killing
the sick in three hours; and so general was the infection,
that, in some places, one half of the inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
died. In 1528 it also raged with great violence; the
sick sometimes dying in four hours. The last attack,
in 1551, was also very violent. In 1529 it appeared in
Holland and Germany, destroying great numbers of
people; but it hath not been observed, at least in any
remarkable degree, in those countries since that time.
In the course of the 17th century, various parts of Europe
have suffered very much from the plague in its
usual form. Indeed (for reasons given in the subsequent
section) we can scarce suppose the pestilential
contagion ever to have ceased entirely. In 1603, London
was visited with the plague; and on this occasion
the practice of shutting up infected houses was first
introduced<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> In 1656 another plague took place in
the same metropolis, but does not appear to have made
any violent attack. In Naples it raged that year with
great fury; destroying, according to some accounts,
fifteen thousand, according to others, twenty thousand,
a day. But these accounts the author of the Journal
just quoted, with great probability, supposes to have
been exaggerated. Others say, that four hundred thousand
Neapolitans were destroyed by this infection; so
that we must at any rate believe it to have been very
violent. In the plague of London in 1665, immense
numbers perished; and particular accounts were published
of this calamity; of which an abridgment is
given in the Appendix to this work, No. III. Since
that time it has not been known in Britain; but other
parts of Europe have not been equally fortunate. In
the beginning of the eighteenth century it appeared in
several parts of the continent; particularly in Copenhagen
in the year 1711; where it committed great ravages,
as it had done at Dantzic two years before; but in
1720 it appeared at Marseilles in France, where it
raged with such fury as to destroy sixty out of the hundred
thousand supposed to be the whole population of
the place<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> Since that time France hath been free
from the distemper; but in Sicily, the dominions of
the Ottoman Porte, and places adjacent, it hath been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
felt very severely. In 1743 it was supposed to have
destroyed two thirds of the inhabitants of Messina. A
particular account of its ravages was read before the
Royal Society of London by Dr. Mead. The following
is taken from Dr. Lobb’s Treatise on the Plague.
“From the beginning of June to the end of July, of
forty thousand inhabitants, two thirds perished. The
disorders in the city were incredible. All the bakers
died, and no bread was baked for many days. The
streets were full of dead bodies; at one time from
twelve to fifteen thousand remaining in the open
air: men, women and children, rich and poor, all together
dragged to the church doors. The vaults being
full, and the living not sufficient to carry the dead
out of the city, they were obliged to put them on
funeral piles, and burn them promiscuously. Nothing
was more shocking than to see people, far above
the common stations, go about begging for a loaf of
bread, when they could hardly walk, with their
tumours upon them; and few were in a state to help
them. All these calamities did not hinder the most
execrable villanies, which were committed every moment;
and, though so few survived, the governor
was obliged to make several public examples.”</p>

<p>In the Turkish dominions, though we have not read
of such extraordinary devastations as formerly took place,
yet we are assured that the pestilence rages there very
frequently. From 1756 to 1762 we have histories of it
by Dr. Russel and others, the substance of which accounts
is given in the Appendix, No. V. In the time
of the great war between the Turks and Russians, it
found its way to Moscow, which city it invaded in 1771.
M. Savary says, it was brought thither by infected merchandise
from the store houses of the Jews; and that
it carried off two hundred thousand people. In the
sixth volume of the Medical Commentaries, however,
we are told that it was brought from the army by two
soldiers; both of whom were carried into the military
hospital, and both died. The anatomist who dissected
their bodies died also. The infection quickly seized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the hospital, and thence the whole city. This happening
in the beginning of the year, its progress was for
some time checked by the cold; but its ravages became
greater as the summer advanced. It raged most
violently during the months of July, August and September;
in which time there were instances of its
destroying twelve hundred persons in a day. Twenty-five
thousand died in the month of September; in the
course of which month scarce one in an hundred of the
infected recovered. Only seventy thousand, according
to this account, perished by the disease. The year 1773
proved very fatal to Bassorah; where, as formerly mentioned,
two hundred and seventy-five thousand perished
in the summer season, through the violence of the distemper<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>
But in countries where the plague rages so
frequently, and where there are few that make observations
with any accuracy, we cannot expect complete
histories of every attack made by it; neither would the
limits of this Treatise admit of a detail of them, though
there were. We know, however, that since the year
we speak of, the plague has ravaged Dalmatia, particularly
in the year 1784, when it almost desolated the
town of Spalatro, destroying three or four thousand of
its inhabitants. Though some countries therefore have
for a number of years remained free from the attacks
of this terrible enemy, yet there are others where it is
as it were stored up, and from whence it may, on a
proper occasion, break forth as formerly, and once
more spread ruin and desolation through the world.</p>

<p class="pl1hi1 fs95"><i>Of the Countries where the Plague is supposed to originate.&mdash;The
Influence of Climate in producing Diseases&mdash;And
of the Moral Conduct of the Human Race in producing
and influencing the same.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">I<span class="ls01em">N</span> considering the origin of a calamity so dreadful
and so universal, we might reasonably suppose that
the fatal spots which gave rise to it would long ago have
been marked out and abandoned by the human race
altogether. But this is far from being the case. In the
accounts already given of various plagues, they are always
said to have been imported from country to country,
but never to have originated in that of the person
who wrote of them. If a plague arose in Greece, we are
told it came from Egypt; if in Egypt, it came from
Ethiopia; and had we any Ethiopic historians, they
would no doubt have told us that it came from the land
of the Hottentots, from Terra Australis Incognita, or
some other country as far distant as possible from their
own. In short, though it has been a most generally
received opinion, that plagues are the immediate effects
of the displeasure of the Deity on account of the sins of
men; yet, except David and Homer (already quoted)
we find not one who has had the candour to acknowledge
that a plague originated among his countrymen
on account of their sins in particular. In former times
Egypt and Ethiopia were marked out as the two great
sources of the plague; and even as late as the writings
of Dr. Mead we find that the same opinion prevailed.
The Doctor, who attempts to explain the causes of the
plague, derives it entirely from the filth of the city of
Cairo, particularly of the canal that runs through it.
But later writers, who have visited and resided in Egypt,
assure us that the country is extremely healthy, and that
the plague is always brought there from Constantinople.
It is true that Dr. Timone, in the Philosophical Transactions,
No. 364, tells us, that it appears from daily
observation, as well as from history, that the plague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
comes to Constantinople from Egypt; but the united
testimonies of Savary, Volney, Mariti and Russel, who
all agree that Egypt receives the infection from Constantinople,
must undoubtedly preponderate.</p>

<p>“The pestilence (says M. Savary) is not a native of
Egypt. I have collected information from the Egyptians,
and foreign physicians who have lived there
twenty or thirty years; which all tended to prove the
contrary. They have assured me that this epidemic
disease was brought thither by the Turks, though it
has committed great ravages. I myself saw the caravelles
of the Grand Signior, in 1778, unlade, according
to custom, the silks of Syria at Damietta. The plague
is almost always on board; and they landed, without
opposition, their merchandise, and their people who
had the plague. It was the month of August; and,
as the disease was then over in Egypt, it did not
communicate that season. The vessels set sail, and
went to poison other places. The summer following,
the ships of Constantinople, alike infected, came to
the port of Alexandria, where they landed their diseased
without injury to the inhabitants. It is an observation
of ages, that if, during the months of June,
July and August, infected merchandise be brought
into Egypt, the plague expires of itself, and the people
have no fears; and if brought at other seasons,
and communicated, it then ceases. A proof that it
is not a native of Egypt is, that, except in times of
great famine, it never breaks out in Grand Cairo, nor
the inland towns, but always begins at the seaports
on the arrival of Turkish vessels, and travels to the
capital; whence it proceeds as far as Syria. Having
come to a period in Cairo, and being again introduced
by the people of Upper Egypt, it renews with
greater fury, and sometimes sweeps off two or three
hundred thousand souls; but always stops in the
month of June, or those who catch it then are easily
cured. Smyrna and Constantinople are now the
residence of this most dreadful affliction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>M. Volney informs us, that the European merchants
residing at Alexandria agree in declaring that the disease
never proceeds from the internal parts of the country,
but always makes its first appearance on the sea-coasts
at Alexandria; from thence it passes to Rosetta,
from Rosetta to Cairo, and from Cairo to Damietta,
and through the rest of the Delta. It is invariably preceded
by the arrival of some vessel from Smyrna or Constantinople;
and it is observed, that if the plague has been
violent during the summer, the danger is greater for
the Alexandrians during the following winter.</p>

<p>To the same purpose, the Abbe Mariti says, “The
plague does not usually reside in Syria, nor is this
the place where it usually begins. It receives this
fatal present from Egypt, where its usual seat is
Alexandria, Cairo or Damietta. The plague of 1760
came at once from Cairo and Alexandria; to the
latter of which it had been brought from Constantinople.
When it comes from that capital, as well as
from the cities of Smyrna and Salonica, it acquires a
peculiar malignity; and its activity never expands
itself with more fury than in the plains of Egypt,
which it overspreads with incredible rapidity. It is
observed, that this plague, so destructive to Egypt,
seldom attacks Syria; but that the latter has every
thing to dread from a plague hatched in the bosom
of Egypt.”</p>

<p>The testimony of these three authors, who have all
been lately on the spot, must certainly have very great
weight, especially when corroborated by that of Dr.
Russel; for which see Appendix, No. V. But still there
is some difficulty. M. Savary informs us, that, <i>except in
cases of great famine</i>, the disease never breaks out in
Cairo; which certainly implies that in cases of famine
it does originate in the city itself; and Mariti, by saying
that the Syrians have much reason to dread a plague
<i>hatched in the bosom</i> of Egypt, undoubtedly intimates
that plagues sometimes do originate in Egypt. Smyrna
and Salonica likewise seem to come in for their share of
the blame; and Dr. McBride, in his Practice of Physic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
informs us, that some parts of Turky are visited by the
plague once in six or seven years; and M. Savary says,
that Egypt is visited with it once in four or five years;
but if Egypt never receives it but from Turky, it would
seem that the plague could at least be no more frequent
than in that country; or, if the fact be otherwise, that
the disease must either originate in Egypt itself, or be
brought to it from some other country than Turky.
Dr. Timone, in the paper already quoted<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> tells us,
that the plague has taken up its residence in Constantinople;
but that, though the seeds of the old plague
are scarce ever wanting, yet a new infection is likewise
imported from time to time. Thus, in attempting to
find out the countries where the plague originates, we
are led in a circle. Constantinople accuses Egypt, and
Egypt recriminates on Constantinople. Ethiopia, the
most distant and least known of those countries which
in former times had any connexion with the more civilized
parts of the world, for a long time bore the blame
of all; but the Jesuit missionaries who resided long in
Abyssinia (the ancient Ethiopia) do not mention the
plague as more common in that country than some
others; neither does Mr. Bruce, in the accounts he has
published, take notice of any such thing. Ethiopia
could not speak for itself, by reason of the ignorance
and barbarity of its inhabitants; and Constantinople is
now very much in the same predicament. The investigation
of this subject therefore would require an accurate
account of the climates of those countries where
the plague is found to commit the greatest ravages, and
a comparison of them with those which are now accounted
the most unhealthy in other respects, and likewise
a comparison of the diseases produced in the latter,
with the true plague.</p>

<p>The most unhealthy climates now existing (those
where the plague commonly rages excepted) are to be
met with in the hottest parts of the world; the East
and West Indies, the wastes of Africa, and some parts
of America. In all these, Dr. Lind, who has written a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
treatise on the diseases incident to Europeans in hot
climates, seems to lay the whole blame upon the heat
and moisture accompanying it. In the East Indies
Bencoolen, in the island of Sumatra, is the most unhealthy
of all the English settlements; but he informs
us, that by building their fort on a dry, elevated place,
about three miles from the town, it became sufficiently
healthy. Next to this, Bengal is most subject to sickness;
for which he assigns the following reason: “The
rainy season commences at Bengal in June, and continues
till October; the remainder of the year is healthy
and pleasant. During the rains, this rich and fertile
country is covered by the Ganges, and converted as it
were into a large pool of water. In the month of October,
when the stagnated water begins to be exhaled by
the heat of the sun, the air is then greatly polluted by
the vapours from the slime and mud left by the Ganges,
and by the corruption of dead fish and other animals.
Diseases then rage, attacking chiefly such as are lately
arrived. The distempers are fevers of the remitting or
intermitting kind; for, though sometimes they may
continue several days without sensible remission, yet
they have in general a great tendency to it. If the season
be very sickly, some are seized with a malignant fever,
of which they soon die. The body is covered with
blotches of a livid colour, and the corpse, in a few
hours, turns quite livid and corrupted. At this time
fluxes prevail, which may be called bilious or putrid,
the better to distinguish them from others which are
accompanied with inflammation of the bowels. The
island of Bombay has of late been rendered much more
healthy than it formerly was, by a wall built to prevent
the encroachments of the sea, where it formed a salt
marsh; and by an order that none of the natives should
manure their cocoa-trees with putrid fish.</p>

<p>“Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East India dominions,
is annually subject to a fatal and consuming
sickness. Here the Dutch, in attempting to make this,
their capital in India, resemble their cities in Europe,
have adorned it with canals or ditches, intersecting each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
other, running through every part of it. Notwithstanding
the utmost care to keep these clean, during the
rainy season, and after it, they become extremely noxious
to the inhabitants, but especially to strangers. It
has been remarked, that the sickness rages with the
greatest violence when the rains have abated, and the
sun has evaporated the water in the ditches, so that the
mud begins to appear. This happened in 1764, when
some British ships of war had occasion to stay for a little
time at Batavia. The stench from the mud was intolerable;
the fever was of the remitting kind; some were
suddenly seized with a delirium, and died in the first
fit; but none survived the attack of a third. Nor was
the sickness at that time confined to the ships; the
whole city afforded a scene of disease and death; streets
covered with funerals, bells tolling from morning to
night, and horses jaded with dragging the dead in herses
to their graves. At that time a slight cut of the skin,
the least scratch of a nail, or the most inconsiderable
wound, turned quickly into a putrid, spreading ulcer,
which, in twenty-four hours, consumed the flesh, even
to the bone. Besides these malignant and remitting fevers,
which rage during the wet season in the unhealthy
parts of the East Indies, Europeans, especially such as
live intemperately, are also subject to fluxes, and to an
inflammation, or disease of the liver; which last is almost
peculiar to India, and particularly to the Coromandel
coast.”</p>

<p>In the same work we have an extract from Mr. Ives’s
journal of a journey from India to Europe by land.
“Gambroon in Persia, says he, is very unhealthful.
Few Europeans escape being seized with putrid intermitting
fevers, which rage from May to September,
and are often followed with obstructions of the liver.
Various authors who have treated of Gambroon, do,
as well as the present English factory, impute its unhealthfulness,
during the summer months, to the noxious
effluvia with which the air is contaminated, from
the great quantities of blubber fish left by the sea upon
the shore, and which very soon become highly offensive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
In the rainy seasons, at the island of Karee,
in the Persian Gulf, intermitting fevers and fluxes are
the usual distempers. On our arrival at Bagdad (supposed
to contain 500,000 souls) we found a purple
fever raging in the city; but though it was computed
that an eighth part of the inhabitants were ill, yet the
distemper was far from being mortal. Here we were
informed that the Arabs had broken down the banks
of the river near Bassorah, with a design to cover with
water the deserts in its neighbourhood. This, it seems,
is the usual method of revenge taken by the Arabs for
any injury done them by the Turks at Bassorah; and
was represented to us as an act of the most shocking
barbarity, since a general consuming sickness would
undoubtedly be the consequence. This was the case
fifteen years before, when the Arabs, by demolishing
the banks of this river, laid the environs of Bassorah
under water. The stagnating and putrefying water in
the adjacent country, and the great quantity of dead
and corrupted fish at that time lying upon the shore,
polluted the whole atmosphere, and produced a putrid
and most mortal fever, of which between twelve and
fourteen thousand of the inhabitants perished; and, at
the same time, not above two or three of the Europeans
who were settled there escaped. The effects of the
violent heats we endured were, an entire loss of appetite,
a faintness and gripes, with frequent and bilious
stools; which greatly exhausted our strength. My
stomach was often so weak, that it could receive only
a little milk. Several of us became feverish through
the excessive heat, and were obliged to have recourse
to gentle vomits, &amp;c. Though we were furnished
with the most ample conveniencies for travelling,
which money, or the strongest recommendations to
the principal christians, as well as mahometan chiefs,
could procure, and had laid in a quantity of excellent
madeira, claret, and other provisions, &amp;c. yet most
of us suffered in our constitutions by this long and fatiguing
journey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>On these climates in general Dr. Lind observes, that
in well cultivated countries, such as China, the air is
temperate and wholesome; while the woody and uncultivated
parts prove fatal to multitudes accustomed to
breathe a purer air. In all places also, near the muddy
and impure banks of rivers, or the foul shores of the sea,
mortal diseases are produced from the exhalations, especially
during the rainy season. “There is a place
near Indrapour, in Sumatra, where no European can
venture to remain, or sleep one night on shore, during
the rainy season, without running the hazard of his
life, or at least of a dangerous fit of sickness; and at
Podang, a Dutch settlement on Sumatra, the air has
been found so bad, that it is commonly called the
Plague-Coast. Here a thick, pestilential vapour or fog
arises, after the rains, from the marshes, which destroys
all the white inhabitants.”</p>

<p>In treating of the diseases of Africa, the same author
takes notice of those of Egypt; which country, he says,
is rendered unwholesome by the annual inundation of
the Nile, and being surrounded on three sides by large
and extensive deserts of sand, by which means it is exposed
to the effects of that noisome vapour, which, during
the summer months, arises from sultry, hot sand.
He doth not, however, say, that the true plague originates
in this country, either from the inundation of the
Nile or any other cause. On the climate of Egypt
I shall once more quote M. Savary, who is a strenuous
advocate for its healthiness, and is at pains to confute
the opinion of Mr. Pauw, and others, who assert the
contrary. “Mr. Pauw (says he) pretends, that at present
Egypt is become, by the negligence of the Turks
and Arabs, the cradle of the pestilence; that another
epidemical disease, equally dreadful, appears here, by
the caravans of Nubia; that the culture of rice engenders
numerous maladies; that the want of rain
and thunder occasions the air of the Thebais to acquire
a violence that ferments the humours of the human
body, &amp;c.” “These assertions (M. Savary observes)
have an air of probability, which might impose on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
people who have not lived in Egypt; but Mr. Pauw
has ventured opinions in his closet, without the guidance
of experience. In vallies, indeed, enclosed by
high mountains, where the atmosphere is not continually
renewed by a current of air, the culture of rice
is unwholesome, but not so, near Damietta and Rosetta.
The plains are nearly on a level with the sea;
neither hill nor height impedes the refreshing breath of
the north, which drives the clouds and exhalations off
the flooded fields southwards, continually purifies the
atmosphere, and preserves the health of the people;
so that the husbandmen who cultivate the rice are not
more subject to diseases than those who do not. The
heats of the Thebais certainly surpass those of many
countries under the equator. Reaumer’s thermometer,
when the burning breath of the south is felt, sometimes
rises to thirty-eight degrees above the freezing
point<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> often to thirty-six. Were heat the principle
of diseases, the <i>Said</i> (Upper Egypt) would not be habitable;
but it only seems to occasion a burning fever,
to which the inhabitants are subject; and which they
cure by regimen, drinking much water, and bathing
in the river: in other respects they are strong and
healthy. Old men are numerous, and many ride on
horseback at eighty. The food they eat in the hot
season contributes much to the preservation of their
health; it is chiefly vegetables, pulse and milk. In
Lower Egypt, the neighbourhood of the sea, the large
lakes, and the abundance of the waters, moderate the
sun’s heat, and preserve a delightful temperature.
Strabo and Diodorus Siculus, who long lived here,
did not think the country unhealthy. There is, indeed,
an unwholesome season in Egypt. From February
till the end of May, the south winds blow at intervals,
and load the atmosphere with a subtile dust,
which makes breathing difficult, and drive before
them pernicious exhalations. Sometimes the heat
becomes insupportable, and the thermometer suddenly
rises twelve degrees. The inhabitants call this season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
<i>Khamsin, fifty</i>; because these winds are most felt
between Easter and Whitsuntide; during which season
they eat rice, vegetables, fresh fish and fruit;
bathing frequently, and using plenty of perfumes and
lemon juice; with which regimen they prevent the
dangerous effects of the Khamsin. But it must not
be supposed that this wind, which corrupts meat in a
few hours, blows fifty days. Egypt would become a
desert. It seldom blows three days together; and
sometimes is only an impetuous whirlwind, which rapidly
passes, and injures only the traveller overtaken in
the deserts. When at Alexandria a tempest of this
kind suddenly arose, driving before it torrents of burning
sand, the serenity of the sky disappeared, a thick
veil obscured the heavens, and the sun became blood-coloured.
The dust penetrated even the chambers, and
burnt the face and eyes. In four hours the tempest
ceased, and the clearness of the day appeared. Some
wretches in the deserts were suffocated, and several
I saw brought to appearance dead; some of whom,
by bathing in cold water, were restored to life.”</p>

<p>The internal parts of the continent of Africa are but
little known. The northern parts, containing the States
of Barbary, are sufficiently healthy; the middle parts
of the western coast, known by the names of Negro-land,
Guinea, &amp;c. are extremely unhealthy and pernicious
to strangers. Dr. Lind informs us, that, at a
distance, this country appears in most places flat, covered
with low, suspended clouds; and on a nearer approach
heavy dews fall in the night time; the land being
every morning and evening wrapped up in a fog. The
ground is clothed with a pleasant and perpetual verdure,
but altogether uncultivated, excepting a few
spots, which are generally surrounded with forests or
thickets of trees, impenetrable to refreshing breezes,
and fit only for the resort of wild beasts. The banks
of the rivers and rivulets are overgrown with bushes
and weeds, continually covered with slime, which sends
forth an intolerable stench. All places however are
not equally unhealthy; nor is any place equally unwholesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
at all times of the year. It is only with the
rainy season that the sickness commences. But as it
would be tedious, and not answer our present purpose,
to enumerate those places which are healthy, and those
which are not, I shall only extract from Dr. Lind’s
work an account of one which seems to be as bad as
can well be imagined. It is called <i>Catchou</i>, a town belonging
to the Portuguese, and situated in 12 degrees
N. lat. “I believe (says the author of this account)
there is scarce to be found on the whole face of the
earth a more unhealthy country than this during the
rainy season. We were thirty miles distant from the
sea, in a country altogether uncultivated, overflowed
with water, surrounded with thick, impenetrable
woods, and overrun with slime. The air was vitiated,
noisome and thick, insomuch that the lighted torches
or candles burnt dim, and seemed ready to be extinguished;
even the human voice lost its natural tone.
The smell of the ground, and of the houses, was raw
and offensive; but the vapour arising from the putrid
water in the ditches was much worse. All this, however,
seemed tolerable, in respect of the infinite numbers
of insects swarming every where, both on the
ground and in the air; which, as they seemed to be
produced and cherished by the putrefaction of the atmosphere,
so they contributed greatly to increase its
impurity. The wild bees from the woods, together
with millions of ants, overran and destroyed the furniture;
while swarms of cock-roaches often darkened
the air, and extinguished even the candles in their
flight; but the greatest plague was the musquetoes
and sand-flies, whose incessant buzz and painful stings
were more insupportable than any symptom of the fever.
Besides all these, an incredible number of frogs,
on the banks of the river, made such a constant and
disagreeable croaking, that nothing but being accustomed
to such an hideous noise, could permit the enjoyment
of natural sleep. In the beginning of October,
as the rains abated, the weather became very hot,
the woods were covered with abundance of dead frogs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and other vermin, left by the recess of the river; all
the mangroves and shrubs were likewise overspread
with stinking slime.”</p>

<p>No doubt these accounts are calculated to inspire us
with dreadful ideas of the countries mentioned in them.
What could be done by the putrefaction of dead animals
and vegetables, certainly would be done here; the
produce, however, was not the true plague; not even
in <i>Catchou</i>; but “a sickness which could not well be
characterised by any denomination commonly applied
to fevers; it however approached neared to what is
called a nervous fever, as the pulse was always low, and
the brain and nerves principally affected,” &amp;c. Certainly
if in any country heat, moisture and putrefaction
could produce a plague, it would be in this. Yet, in all
the places we have mentioned, whether India, Arabia,
Egypt, or Guinea, (and we might go through the whole
world in the same manner) we have not been able to
find either moist heat or dry heat, even when aided by
putrefaction, insects, and nastiness of all kinds (not justly
chargeable upon any climate;) I say, we have not
found the united powers of all these able to produce a
plague. Nay, it is even doubtful whether climates can
produce those inferior diseases above mentioned. Even Dr.
Lind, who appears to be so willing to ascribe every thing
to climate, seems embarrassed in this respect. “There
are many difficulties (says he) which occur in assigning
a satisfactory reason, why in some countries, as in those
between the tropics, heavy and continual rains should
produce sickness; while in other places, especially in
the southern parts of Europe, a want of rain for two or
three months in summer brings on diseases almost similar.
Upon this occasion (adds the Doctor) I cannot
help observing, that there is hardly a physical cause
which can be assigned for the produce of any disease,
that will not admit of some exceptions: thus, not only
the woods and morasses in Guinea are tolerably healthy,
with some exceptions, in the dry season; but a few
instances might be produced of towns surrounded with
marshes and a foggy air, where the inhabitants suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
no inconvenience from their situation, even during the
rainy season. Do the impetuous torrents of water poured
from the clouds during the rainy seasons, in tropical
countries, contain what is unfriendly to health? Thus
much is certain, that the natives of such countries, especially
the mulattoes, avoid being exposed to these
rains as much as possible, and when wet with them
immediately plunge themselves into salt water, if near
it. They generally bathe once a day, but never in
the fresh water rivers, when overflown with rains,
preferring at such times the water of springs. Is the
sickness of these seasons to be ascribed to the intense
heat of the then almost vertical sun; which frequently,
for an hour or two at noon, dispels the clouds, and
with its direct beams instantly changes the refreshing
coolness of the air into a heat almost insupportable?</p>

<p>“Further: As the season of those sudden and terrible
storms, called the hurricanes, in the East and West
Indies, and tornadoes on the coast of Guinea, partly
coincides with that of the rains, do these dreadful
tempests in any measure contribute to produce the
prevailing sickness at those times? It was remarkable
one year at Senegal, that, in the beginning of the
rainy season, in the night succeeding one of these tornadoes,
a great number of the soldiers, and two thirds
of the English women, were taken ill, this garrison
before having been uncommonly healthy.</p>

<p>“Lastly: Is it not more probable, as in those
countries the earth for six or eight months in the
year receives no moisture from the heavens but what
falls in dews, which every night renew the vegetation,
and reinstate the delightful verdure of the grass, that
the surface of the ground in many places becomes
hard and incrustated with a dry scurf, which pens up
the vapours below, until, by the continuance of the
rains for some time, this crust is softened, and the
vapours set free? That these dews do not penetrate
deep into the surface of the earth, is evident from the
constant dryness and hardness of such spots of ground,
in those countries, as are not covered with grass and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
other vegetables. Thus the large rivers, in the dry
season, being confined within narrow bounds, leave a
great part of their channel uncovered, which, having
its moisture totally exhaled, becomes a hard, dry crust;
but, no sooner the rains fall, than, by degrees, this
long parched up crust of earth and clay gradually
softens, and the ground, which before had not the
least smell, begins to emit a stench, which in four or
five weeks becomes exceeding noisome; at which time
the season of sickness commences.”</p>

<p>From these quotations it must certainly appear, that
the author himself is dissatisfied with his theory; and
that, though in the outset he thought heat and moisture,
assisted by the exhalations from putrid animal and
vegetable substances, sufficient to produce the disorders
of which he treats, yet, on a more minute investigation,
he is obliged to acknowledge, that something inexplicable
still remains. This he now wishes to solve by unknown
properties in the water, by confined exhalations,
&amp;c. But as the consideration of these things belongs
properly to the next section, I shall here only remark,
that there hath not yet been given any satisfactory account
of the origin of epidemic diseases of what I call
the <i>inferior</i> kind, much less of the true plague, which
stands above them all, as I have already said, like the
serpent Python above other serpents.</p>

<p>To what has been quoted from Dr. Lind, I shall here
subjoin the testimony of Dr. Clark, who had an opportunity
of observing the epidemic diseases which raged at
Bengal in 1768 and 1769. These were, “the remittent
fever and dysentery, which begin in August, and
continue till November. During the beginning of
the epidemic, the fever is attended with extreme malignity
and danger; frequently carrying off the patient
in twelve hours; and, if not stopped, generally proves
fatal on the third or fourth day. In August the remissions
are very imperceptible; in October they
become more distinct; and, as the cold weather comes
on, the fever becomes a regular intermittent. At
that time, too, the putrid dysentery begins to rage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
with the fever. These diseases were very fatal to many
Europeans, particularly new comers, in 1768. But
in the year 1770, when there was a scarcity of rice,
it was computed, that about eighty thousand natives,
and one thousand five hundred Europeans, died at
Bengal. The streets were covered with funerals; the
river floated with dead carcases; and every place exhibited
the most melancholy scenes of disease and
death. During the sickly seasons at Bengal, the uncertainty
of life is so great, that it frequently happens
that one may leave a friend at night in perfect health,
who shall not survive next day. There have been
several instances of persons who have returned home
in a state of perfect health from performing the last
duties to a deceased friend, and have next day been
numbered with the dead. But the cool, agreeable
season, from December to March, is productive of no
prevailing diseases. The complaints to be met with
are in general the consequences, or remains, of the diseases
of the former period. The complaints which
the Europeans are subject to in the dry months are,
the cholera and diarrhœa. Fluxes and fevers are then
seldom epidemic; and, when they do happen, are not
attended with much danger.</p>

<p>“At Batavia the rainy season is from November to
May, during which time malignant, remitting and
continued fevers and the dysentery rage with great fatality.
Captain Cook, in his first voyage, arrived
here in October 1779; the whole crew, excepting
Tupia, a native of Otaheite, being in the most perfect
health. But, in the course of nine days, they experienced
the fatal effects of the climate, and buried
seven people at Batavia. On the 3d of December,
the ship left the harbour. At that time the number
of sick amounted to forty; and the rest of the ship’s
company were in a very feeble condition. When the
ship anchored at Prince’s Island, in the Straits of
Sunda, the sickness increased, and they buried twenty-three
persons more in the course of about six weeks.
The Grenville Indiaman, which touched at this island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
in 1771, suffered equally from the malignity of the
air. A few were taken on board, when the ship sailed
from Batavia, ill of a malignant fever; which spread
by contagion at sea, and carried off great numbers.
I visited several in this ship, when she arrived at China,
who were reduced to mere skeletons, by the duration
of the fever and dysentery; both of which were
most certainly propagated by contagion.</p>

<p>“Those parts of Sumatra lying immediately under
the line are continually subject to rain, and the
ground near the shore is low, and covered with thick
trees and underwood. The heat being intense, noisome
fogs arise, which corrupt the air, and render the
country fatal to foreigners. The land of North
Island, which lies on this coast, near the beginning of
the Straits of Sunda, appears at a distance finely variegated;
but at the place where the wood and water
are to be got it is low, and covered with impenetrable
mangroves, and infested with a variety of insects. It
is here that most of the East India ships take in wood
for their homeward voyage. A Danish ship, in 1768,
anchored in this island, and sent twelve of her hands
on shore to fill water; where they only remained two
nights. Every one of them was seized with a fever,
whereof none recovered: but although the ship went
out to sea, none, except the twelve who went on
shore, were attacked with the complaint.”</p>

<p>With regard to China, this author says, that the
“port of Canton is by no means so healthy as is generally
represented. The comparative degree of health
which Europeans enjoy here has been ascertained from
the instances of the supercargoes, which is, however,
a very erroneous standard. The generous and regular
way in which these gentlemen live, for the most part,
exempts them from diseases; and, being but few in
number, no great mortality can take place among
them. But seamen, who never observe much regularity
in their way of living, who work hard in the
day time, are but badly clothed, and not provided
against the damps and cold north-easterly winds at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
night, seldom fail to be afflicted with the diseases already
mentioned (fevers and fluxes.) Even the factors
of different nations, who reside here for any considerable
time, experience all the inconveniences peculiar
to any sultry climate: florid health is a stranger
to their countenances; their constitutions are soon
weakened and enfeebled; and they become subject to
habitual fluxes and other complaints, the usual consequences
of too great relaxation.”</p>

<p>The climate of the southern part of China, according
to the same author, is excessively hot during the summer
months. Even in September and October, when
the nights are cold, the days continue to be sultry.
The cold months are, December, January and February;
“and during this time the vicissitudes of the weather
are more quick than in any other part of the world.
When the wind is northerly, and the thermometer at
46, upon a change of the wind to the south, it is next
day up to 60 or 70. People who reside here are always
at a loss with regard to their clothing; one day
finding a silk coat sufficient; and the next, upon a
sudden change of wind, finding it necessary to wear a
flannel waistcoat.”</p>

<p>On the subject of climate, therefore, I must conclude
with the following observations:&mdash;First: That, as the
diseases above mentioned are produced both in moist
and dry countries, in those in the torrid and those in
the temperate zone, they can neither be the offspring
of moisture or drought, of heat or cold, of septics or
antiseptics, but of something not yet discovered. Second:
That, upon fair investigation, it does not appear,
that ancient historians have been able to ascertain the origin
of any plague whatever: they have universally ascribed
it to the anger of the Deity, while their own pride
would never allow it to have originated in any country
with which they were connected. Third: It doth not
by any means appear, that the climates of those countries,
where the plague is known to be most common, are
at all inferior to those already described, excepting the very
circumstance of having the plague frequently in them:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
nay, indeed, that they are equally bad. Nobody will
pretend to argue, that the climate of Asia Minor, of
Greece, of the Morea, or of any of the countries most
infected with the plague, was, or is, worse than that of
<i>Catchou</i> in Africa, already described; yet it is certain,
that we have a number of testimonies that the plague
has ravaged Asia Minor, while we have not one of its
visiting <i>Catchou</i>. Ancient Greece, the Peloponnesus
(Morea) and Asia Minor, were accounted healthy and
fine countries; and modern travellers assure us, that
they have not degenerated in this respect; yet these
countries are desolated by the plague, while the unwholesome
regions above described are entirely free
from it, unless imported from some other quarter. To
give this matter, however, as fair a discussion as possible,
I shall here consider the account we have of the climate
of Bassorah, given by the gentleman residing there in
1780; whose case, in the remitting fever, is given, Appendix,
No. VI. “The overflowing of the Euphrates,
and its waters stagnating in the desert, have always
been accounted primary causes of epidemical diseases
at Bassorah. The great floods from the melting of
the snow on the mountains of Diarbekir, the ancient
Assyria, happened in the year 1780, early in the
month of May, when the heats in Persia and Arabia
begin to be excessive. The desert, which reaches to
the gates of Bassorah, is, for many miles, incrusted
with a surface of salt; which, when mixed with the
stagnated waters, and exposed to the sun, produces
the most noxious effluvia. As early as the 25th of
May, the town was surrounded by a salt marsh, the
heated steam arising from which was, at times, almost
intolerable; but the canal that runs through a great
part of the city being filled with the bodies of animals,
and all kinds of putrid matter; and, at low
tides, all these substances exposed to the sun, made
the air in the town scarce supportable; and, being
totally destitute of police, the streets were in many
places covered with human ordure, the bodies of
dead dogs and cats, &amp;c. which emitted a stench more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
disagreeable and putrid than any thing I ever experienced
in my life. As to the degree of solar heat, it
far exceeded what I conceived the human frame to be
capable of bearing. The sensation under this heat
was totally different from what I had ever experienced;
it resembled the approach of an heated substance
to the body. The quicksilver, in Fahrenheit’s thermometer,
rose to between 156 and 162 degrees<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span>
From the 30th of May I never saw it so low as 156,
but generally between 158 and 160. After I left
Bassorah I was told that it rose still higher. In the
coolest part of the house, with the aid of every invention
to decrease the heat, the quicksilver rose to 115;
but after I came away, I was informed that it rose
still higher, even at seven in the morning, the hour
which we accounted the coolest in the day. Once
the heat was said to be so intolerable, that no one
could expose himself to it long enough to observe the
thermometer in the sun. Some of the oldest inhabitants
of Bassorah said that they never remembered to
have heard of such a heat in any part of Persia or
Arabia. The natives of the country appeared more
alarmed at the heat than the Europeans: nothing
could induce them to expose themselves to the sun
after ten o’clock. I left Bassorah for Aleppo on the
30th of May. On our arrival at Zabira, the heat was
so intense, that even the Arabs sunk under it.”</p>

<p>From this account it was natural to expect that violent
sickness would ensue. This was the opinion of the
inhabitants, and they were not deceived. The sickness,
however, was not the true plague, but a violent remitting
fever; and even this did not originate in the city
itself, but was observed to approach from Asia Minor,
ravaging Diarbekir, and keeping the course of the Tigris,
to Bagdad, where many died. From thence it
followed the course of the Euphrates to Bassorah, and
for about twenty miles lower. The opposite, or Persian
shore, though within a few miles, was exempted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and it did not spread more than twenty miles into the
desert<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span></p>

<p>I might now proceed to give an abstract of what has
been said of the power of climate in producing diseases
on the Western Continent, and West India islands; but
as this belongs more especially to the second part of this
Treatise, I shall here pass it over, as well as what Dr.
Smith has said of the climate of Greece, in the Medical
Repository, and which he endeavours to prove to be similar
to the climate of North America. But, before we
proceed to consider what diseases may be produced by
<i>climate</i> alone, it is proper to discuss the question, how
far man is naturally subject to diseases of any kind?
Many, no doubt, will be apt to suppose this a very absurd
question; for as man is now, by nature, subject to
death, it seems to follow, that he is also naturally subject
to disease, as the means of bringing on death. But,
however plausible this may appear, experience shows,
that disease and death are not always connected. Many
people die of mere old age; the powers of life being
exhausted, and the system so far decayed, that the various
parts of it can no longer perform their offices. On
the other hand, a disease destroys by attacking some
particular organ, and either totally consuming or altering
it in such a manner, that it disturbs the vital operations,
while yet strong and vigorous. We may therefore
compare the death of a person from mere old age to
the natural extinction of a candle when the tallow is
totally consumed; and death from disease, to the blowing
out of a candle while a part of it remains, and might
have burned for a considerably longer time. Thus I
am inclined to consider all diseases as merely accidental;
and this with the greater certainty, because, though, in
common with other believers in revealed religion, I
think that death is the consequence of Adam’s transgression,
yet I do not find that disease of any kind was
threatened except in cases of positive transgression, long
after the days of Adam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Every one allows, that, though some diseases are natural,
some are likewise artificial; but nobody hath attempted
to draw the line of demarcation between them.
Every thing is charged upon climate, heat, moisture,
drought, vapour, &amp;c. and yet, upon examination, we
shall find the utmost difficulty in deriving a single disease
from the causes we assign. No person in his senses will
say that Adam, in consequence of eating the forbidden
fruit, became liable to the venereal disease. As little
can we say for the gout, the stone, or the dropsy; and
if we cannot particularize the diseases to which he became
naturally liable, we have no right to say that any
kind of disease became natural to him in consequence
of his transgression. If, therefore, death itself, originally
not natural to man, did yet take place in
consequence of his moral conduct; and if diseases,
without number, have arisen among his posterity,
though not natural to him in consequence of his first
transgression, we have equal reason to believe that these
diseases have taken place among them in consequence
of their moral or rather <i>immoral</i> conduct, in totally deviating
from the line prescribed them by their Maker,
and following others of their own invention; and this
will appear the more probable, when we consider, that,
long after mankind became subject to death, we find
diseases, particularly the pestilence, threatened as the
consequence of subsequent transgressions.</p>

<p>If, without taking scripture into consideration, we
attend only to what may be gathered from profane history,
we find the testimony of all the ancients concurring
in one general point, viz. that in times of great antiquity
men were more healthy, and even stronger, than in the
times when those authors lived. This is taken notice
of by Homer, when comparing the strength of men in
the time of the Trojan war with those in his days, about
two centuries later<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> Virgil, who lived in much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
modern times than Homer, carries his ideas of the degeneracy
of man much farther; and informs us, that Turnus,
when fighting with Æneas, took up and threw a
stone which twelve men of that time could not have
lifted. Now, though we know that both these accounts
are fabulous, yet they perfectly coincide with the voice
of historians of all nations; for we are universally told,
that the first inhabitants of countries were a brave,
hardy people, living according to the simplicity of nature,
free from diseases, and attaining to a good old age.</p>

<p>This is so conformable to what is generally said at
present, probably very often by rote, without regard to
rational evidence, that, were we so inclined, ample room
might be found for declamation against modern luxuries,
particularly the practice of drinking ardent spirits,
as pernicious to health, and destructive to the human
body. On this subject, however, we may once for
all observe, that, although we find ample evidence of
the baleful influence of these liquors in producing
other diseases, yet we find none of their ever having
had any share in the production of an epidemic or general
disease among mankind. In ancient times the
art of distillation seems to have been unknown; so that
whatever mischief was done in those days must have
been done by wine, or other fermented liquors. In
modern times, though the use both of fermented liquors
and ardent spirits is undoubtedly carried to excess, yet
there is no evidence of their producing an epidemic, or
even making it more violent or general than it would
otherwise have been. Dr. Cleghorn, having spoken
largely of the manner of living of the natives in Minorca,
proceeds thus: “I should next give a circumstantial
account of the diet and way of life of the
British soldiers in this island; but as this would be a
disagreeable task, I shall only observe, that the excess
of drinking is among them an universal vice, confirmed
into habit. But, however different the Spaniards
be from the English, in their meat, drink, exercise,
affections of the mind, and habit of body; yet
the health of both nations is equally influenced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the seasons. An epidemical distemper seldom or
never attacks the one class of inhabitants without
attacking the other also; and, surprising as it may
appear, it is nevertheless true, that the peasants,
remarkable for temperance and regularity, and the
soldiers, who, without meat and clothes, frequently
lie abroad drunk, exposed to all weathers, have diseases
almost similar, both as to their violence and
duration.”</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that excess in drinking hath
put an end to the lives of many individuals; and it hath
been observed, that such as attempt to preserve themselves
from the plague by the use of strong liquors, have
generally fallen sacrifices to it<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> but this cannot prove
that such excess would have brought on the distemper
without some other cause. It hath been certainly
found, that excess in drinking or eating, excess in venery,
excessive fatigue by labour, watching, study, &amp;c.
will all make an epidemic disease more violent when it
attacks a particular person; but no experience hath yet
shown that the <i>first</i> person seized with an epidemic
always fell under this description. All that can be said
on the subject is, that, by such excesses as have already
been described, the body is prepared for receiving the
disease, by an exhaustion, or evaporation (if we please to
call it so) of the vital principle; as wood is prepared for
burning by the evaporation of its moisture; but as
wood, however dry, will not burn without the contact
or application of fire, so neither will the body, though
ever so well prepared, be attacked by any epidemic,
unless the true cause of that epidemic be also applied.</p>

<p>Thus we are still disappointed in our attempts to
discover the origin of the plague. We have seen that
the most unhealthy climates in the world do not produce
it of themselves; neither can the conduct of any
individual bring it upon himself, without an unknown
<i>something</i>, which nobody has yet found out. It was
this difficulty of finding out the natural cause, which
certainly induced by far the greatest number of writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
on the subject to ascribe it to Divine Power; and even
as late a writer as Dr. Hodges tells us, that he believes
in the <i>to Theion</i>, the “finger of God,” in the plague,
as much as any body. As for those who have endeavoured
to account for the origin of this distemper from
an inquiry into natural causes, and conclusions drawn
from the late experiments on air, they have totally failed;
as will be fully elucidated in the following section.</p>

<p>If then we are to believe that diseases, especially those
called epidemics, among which the plague holds the
first place, have arisen in consequence of a certain line
of conduct adopted by the human race, or have been
inflicted by the Deity as punishments on that account,
we are to look for their origin among those to whom the
Deity principally manifested himself; that is, the Jews,
and nations who interfered with them. Among the
Jews we hear of the first general plague distinctly mentioned;
viz. the three days pestilence of David, and to
which it is possible that Homer alludes in his Iliad.
Next to this is the great plague of 767 B.&nbsp;C. said to
have spread all over the world. This coincides with the
time of Pul, king of Assyria; who, having overthrown
the ancient kingdom of Syria, turned his arms against
that of Israel, and no doubt extended his conquests
among the eastern nations, as we know very well the
Assyrian monarchs did. As the ten tribes, ever after
their separation from the house of David, had in a manner
totally given themselves up to idolatry, we are not
to wonder if the pestilence, so frequently threatened by
Moses, was very common, or, as physicians term it, <i>endemic</i>,
among them. Thus, whatever enemy invaded
the country, would almost certainly carry the disease
along with them, and spread it among the other nations
with whom they afterwards had any connexion. At
this time, or even before this, during the wars of Syria
with Israel and Judah, this dreadful pestilence might
begin; but, as to its being all over the world in any
particular year, I do not see how it can be ascertained;
because there are no general histories of the world in
those early times. It appears more probable that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
general pestilence took place at the time that Sennacherib’s
army was destroyed. I have no doubt, indeed,
for the reasons already given, that the plague had infected
Sennacherib’s army before he went into Ethiopia.
In that country, in all probability, he would leave it;
and, after his return to Judea, when the dreadful catastrophe
befel him of an hundred and eighty-five thousand
of his men being destroyed in one night, there can
be no doubt that the remains of his army would carry
with them the seeds of a most malignant pestilence,
capable of spreading destruction far and wide. It is true,
we are not directly told, in Scripture, that the Assyrian
army was destroyed by a plague, but that the angel of
the Lord destroyed them; but, as this expression is
quite similar to what we read of the pestilence in David’s
time, there can be but little doubt that the means
of destruction made use of in both cases were the same.
Josephus expressly says, that Sennacherib’s army was
destroyed by a pestilence. Neither are we to conclude,
because this pestilence was miraculous, that it therefore
certainly killed every one on whom it fell; or that it
would not infect those who came near the sick, as any
other disease of the kind would do.</p>

<p>From the same source may we derive the propensity
in the Carthaginian armies to pestilential disorders.
Carthage was a colony of Tyre; and the Tyrians were
in close alliance with the Jews, during the reigns of
David and Solomon, and very probably afterwards; so
that from them the distemper might be communicated
in such a manner as to be almost endemic; and thus
hardly an army could be sent out but what would have
the infection with it, breaking out with violence now
and then, as occasional causes tended to give life to the
contagion. It is impossible, however, from the source
just mentioned to trace the plague of Athens, or the
first plague in Rome; but it is very natural to suppose
that the violent one which raged in Rome, during the
reign of Titus, came from Jerusalem. That city had
sustained a most dreadful siege, and the obstinate and
wretched inhabitants had endured such calamities as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
have scarcely been recorded in the history of nations.
Among these calamities was a pestilence, which, in all
probability, would be conveyed to Rome, and there
occasion the destruction already mentioned.</p>

<p>But what seems to render this account of the origin of
the plague more probable is, that the Jews are to this day
accused of propagating the disease in those countries where
it is most frequent. Baron de Tott is of opinion that the
plague in Constantinople originates among the Jewish
dealers in old clothes; for these avaricious dealers, purchasing
the infected goods, sell them indiscriminately to
every one who will buy, and that without the least care taken
to remove the infection from them; by which means
it is no wonder to find the plague, as well as other diseases,
disseminated among them in great plenty. Dr. Russel
informs us, that the Jews are most liable to the plague,
the most fearful of it, and the most ready to fly from
the infection. The Abbe Mariti agrees in the same
accusation against this unfortunate people. “The
Jews (says he) purchase at a low price the goods and
wares which remain when most of the family are deceased,
and then store them up; which, when the
plague is over, they sell at a dear rate to those will
buy, and thus propagate the pestilential poison: again
it kindles, and presently causes new destruction.
Thus this opprobrious nation, preferring gold to life,
sell the plague to mussulmen, who purchase it without
fear, and sleep with it, till, renewed of itself, it
hurries them to the grave.” M. Volney, though he
does not mention the Jews in such express terms as
Mariti and Russel, yet agrees as to the mode of its propagation
in Constantinople, and the reason of its continuance
in that city. “It is certain (says he) that the
plague originates in Constantinople, where it is perpetuated
by the absurd negligence of the Turks,
which is so great, that they publicly sell the effects of
persons dead of the distemper. The ships which go
to Alexandria never fail to carry furs and woolen
clothes, purchased on these occasions, which they expose
to sale in the bazar of the city, and thereby spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the contagion. The Greeks who deal in these goods
are almost always the first victims.”</p>

<p>Thus the account we have of the origin of the plague
at present is, that the city of Constantinople, having
been long and deeply infected, the infection is stored up
through the avarice of the Jewish merchants, who buy
the goods and clothes of the infected. The stupidity
of the Turks allows these goods to be sold in Constantinople,
or exported freely to all parts to which their vessels
sail, particularly to Alexandria; where the avarice
of the Greeks prompts them to buy without examination
or precaution, to the destruction of their own lives, and
of multitudes of others. Egypt being the principal place
of traffick, the plague is more frequent there than in
other parts of the empire. Syria is comparatively free
from it; which M. Volney supposes to be owing to the
small number of vessels which come there directly from
Constantinople.</p>

<p>In this way we may, in a pretty plausible manner,
account for the origin of this distemper; viz. that it
originally fell upon the Jews as a punishment for their
iniquities; that from the Jews it has been at different
times conveyed to other nations; and, by a mixture of
those nations, has, at times, become general all over the
world. At last it has, by the avarice of that people who
first had been the occasion of its being introduced into
the world, become permanent in Constantinople, whence
it is still diffused among different nations in proportion
to their dealings with that capital.</p>

<p>But it may now be said, ‘Allowing the positions
contended for to be true in their utmost extent, how
comes it to pass that the plague hath not been general
in every age and in every country? Since the destruction
of Jerusalem, the Jews have been dispersed over all
nations: if nothing then were wanting to produce a
pestilence but Jews and old clothes, no age or country
ought to have been free from it; nevertheless it is certain
that violent plagues take place only at particular
times, with long intervals between; and of late the pestilential
disposition seems to have become much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
frequent than formerly; the western parts of Europe,
particularly Britain, having been free from it for a great
number of years. There must therefore be some cause,
different from what has yet been mentioned, by which
the infection is occasionally roused from inactivity, and
excited to spread desolation all around.’</p>

<p>That there are predisposing causes to epidemic disorders,
especially to the plague, the most fatal of them
all, is not denied. These prepare the body for receiving
the infection, but they will not, without that infection,
produce the disorder. Of these causes so many are to
be found in the conduct of mankind themselves, that
we scarcely need to look for them any where else. In
looking over the histories of plagues, we find them in
an especial manner connected with famines and wars.
The former sometimes take place in consequence of the
failure of crops through natural causes; but, considering
the general fertility of the earth, we must certainly account
it owing to bad management, in some respect or
other, that every country hath not as much laid up
within itself as would guard against the consequences of
at least one or two bad crops. Yet we believe there is
not, at present, a country upon earth in this predicament.
If a crop fails any where, the inhabitants must
import largely, or they must starve. This is the case
even in the fertile regions of the East, where the earth
produces in excessive abundance<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> and there is little or
nothing of any kind of provision exported to other
countries. A remarkable instance of this occurred in
the plague at Aleppo, a history of which is given by Dr.
Russel. He tells us, that the winter of 1756 proved
excessively cold, which was followed by a famine next
year. This account is confirmed by Mr. Dawes, in a
letter to the bishop of Carlisle<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> He tells us, that in
the course of the winter many perished through cold;
that the inhabitants were reduced to such extremities,
by the single failure of the crop in 1757, that women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
were known to eat their own children as soon as they
expired in their arms with hunger; and that human
creatures might be seen contending with dogs, and
scratching for the same bone with them in a dunghill.
A dreadful plague followed; which, the two succeeding
years, swept off not fewer than sixty thousand in the
city of Aleppo.</p>

<p>It is probable that in this case the famine either
produced the plague, or made it worse than it would
have otherwise been; and it is not denied that the cold
and bad season was the direct cause of the famine. But
as little can it be denied, that had the people, or their
governors, been so provident as to have laid up stores
sufficient to supply the country for one year, this famine
would not have been felt. As far, therefore, as the
plague was connected with the famine, we must own
that it was chargeable on the human race themselves;
not the sins of this or that particular person, but a general
deviation from the task assigned them by their
Maker, viz. that of cultivating the ground; and, instead
of this, spending their time in folly and trifling,
to say no worse.</p>

<p>But famines are occasioned not only by natural causes,
but by wars; in which mankind, acting in direct opposition
to the laws of God and nature, destroy and lay
waste the earth, taking every opportunity of reducing
to extremity both those whom they call innocent and
those whom they call guilty. Thus vast multitudes are
reduced to want, to despair, and rendered a prey to grief,
terror, and every depressing passion of the human mind;
they are exposed to every inclemency of the weather;
to the scorching heats of the day, and the chilling damps
of the night; in short, to every thing that we can conceive
capable of predisposing the body for the reception
of diseases of the very worst kind. No wonder therefore
that war and pestilence go hand in hand; and, by
taking a review of the history of mankind, we shall see,
that, always at those times when the nations have been
most actively employed in the trade of butchering one
another, then, or very soon after, they have been afflicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
with pestilence. To begin with the great plague of 767
B.&nbsp;C. which coincides with the rise of the Assyrian empire:
Till this time, though there had been numberless
wars, yet they were carried on upon a much smaller
scale than now, when great empires were to be set up,
and when the most distant nations were to be assembled
in order to gratify the pride and ambition of an individual.
The Assyrians, we know, penetrated into Ethiopia; but
how far east or how far west they went, we are not certainly
informed. To their wars, however, we may with
reason ascribe the desolations occasioned by this first
plague. From Thucydides’s account of the plague at
Athens, it seems plain that it was occasioned, or at least
rendered more violent, by the wars of the Greeks with
one another at that time. Had the Carthaginian army
staid at home when they went to war with Dionysius,
tyrant of Syracuse<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> it is very probable that the pestilence
would not have broke out among them. The
like may be said of the plague which broke out among
them in the time of Marcellus<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> That in the time of Jugurtha,
indeed, is said to have been occasioned by locusts;
but, had not vast bodies of men been collected together for
the purposes of war, the plague could never have committed
such ravages. The plague in the time of Titus
could not have been brought from Jerusalem, nor perhaps
would it have existed there, had not Titus made
war against that city; and so of others.</p>

<p>The plague which began in the reign of Justinian,
as it was more violent than any recorded in history, so
it was preceded by wars equally unexampled. The
Romans had indeed for ages employed themselves in
war; but, by their constant superiority to every adversary,
their empire had become so amazingly extensive,
that, whatever wars were carried on in the remote provinces,
the great body of the empire always remained
at peace; and this was the case even in their most violent
civil wars. On the accession of Alexander Severus,
about the year 232, they began to encounter enemies so
numerous and formidable, that all their power proved
insufficient to repel them. In the tenth year of Alexander’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
reign, the Persians, having overthrown the ancient
empire of the Parthians, turned their arms against
the Romans, and, though frequently defeated at that
time with great slaughter, renewed their incursions in
the reign of Gordian, about the year 242, when they
were in like manner defeated and obliged to retire. As
these defeats, however, did not at all affect the strength
of the Persian empire, the Romans still found them as
formidable enemies as ever; while the Goths, Sarmatians,
Franks, and other northern nations, harassed them
in other parts. In the reign of Decius, who ascended
the throne in 249, they became extremely formidable,
insomuch that the emperor himself, with his whole
army, was at last cut off by them. The consequence of this
was, that the empire was instantly invaded in many
different parts, and, though the barbarians were at times
defeated, we never find that the empire regained its former
tranquillity. The Persians and Scythians, taking
advantage of the general confusion, invaded the provinces
next them, while the finishing stroke seemed to be
given to the Roman affairs by the defeat and captivity
of Valerian by the Persians.</p>

<p>This disaster, as may well be imagined, produced an
immediate invasion by numberless barbarians, while
such multitudes of pretenders to the imperial crown
were set up, each asserting his claim by force of arms,
that the whole Roman territories were filled with bloodshed
and slaughter. At this time Gallienus, the son of
Valerian, was the <i>lawful</i> emperor, if indeed we may apply
the word to the domination of such a monster. His
mode of government may be imagined from the following
letter written to one of his officers in consequence
of a victory gained over an usurper named <i>Ingenuus</i>.
“I shall not be satisfied with your putting to death only
such as have borne arms against me, and might
have fallen in the field: you must in every city destroy
all the males, old and young; spare none who have
<i>wished</i> ill to me, none who have spoken ill of me, the
son of Valerian, the father and brother of princes.
<i>Ingenuus</i> emperor! Tear, kill, cut in pieces, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
mercy: you understand me; do then as you know
I would do, who have written to you with my own
hand.” In consequence of this horrible order, not
a single male child was left alive in some of the cities
of Mœsia, where this inhuman tragedy was acted.</p>

<p>In the midst of this dreadful commotion, we find the
pestilence contributing its share to the common work of
desolation. In Alexandria in Egypt, says Dionysius,
bishop of that place, “fury and discord raged to such
a degree, that it was more easy to pass from the east
to the remotest provinces of the west, than from one
place of Alexandria to another. The inhabitants had
no intercourse but by letters, which were with the
utmost difficulty conveyed from one friend to another.
The port resembled the shores of the Red Sea strewed
with the carcases of the drowned Egyptians: the sea
was dyed with blood, and the Nile choked up with
dead bodies. The war was attended with a general
famine, and the famine with a dreadful plague, which
daily swept off great numbers of people, insomuch
that there were then in Alexandria fewer inhabitants,
from the age of fourteen to that of eighty, than there
used to be from forty to seventy.” It was not in
Egypt alone that this calamity prevailed. It raged with
great violence in Greece, and at Rome itself; where,
for some time, it carried off five thousand persons a day.
Many terrible phenomena of nature took place at the
same time. The sun was overcast with thick clouds,
and great darkness took place for several days, attended
with a violent earthquake, and loud claps of thunder,
not in the air, but in the bowels of the earth, which
opened in several places and swallowed up great numbers
of people in their habitations. The sea, swelling
beyond measure, broke in upon the continent, and
drowned whole cities<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span></p>

<p>At last the civil commotions were settled by the
accession of Claudius to the empire in 268. He found
the Roman force so exhausted, that, when marching
against the Goths, he wrote to the senate in the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
terms: “If I should not be attended with success, you
will remember that I fight after the reign of Gallienus.
The whole empire is quite spent and exhausted, partly
by him, and partly by the many tyrants who, during
his reign, usurped the sovereignty, and laid waste our
provinces. We want even shields, swords and spears.”
In this miserable plight, however, he gained a most
extraordinary victory; three hundred thousand of the
enemy being killed or taken. But, while Claudius thus
carried on the work of death successfully against the
barbarians, he was attacked from a quarter where he
could make no resistance: a violent plague broke out in
his army, and carried off himself and a vast number of
his men.</p>

<p>The dreadful defeat given to the Goths did not long
preserve the tranquillity of the empire. New invasions
took place, and new massacres ensued. At last, on the
accession of Dioclesian to the empire, it was thought
proper, on account of the present emergences, to divide
such wide-extended territories into four parts, to be
governed by four emperors of equal authority. By the
activity and valour of these, particularly of one of them,
named Galerius, the northern barbarians were repressed,
and the Persians reduced so low, that they were obliged
to yield up a great part of their territories; and it is said
that their country might even have been reduced to a
Roman province, had the emperor so inclined. We
know not whether, in his eastern expedition, the Roman
army received any infection, nor do we hear of any
plague breaking out in it; but we are told that Galerius
himself died of an uncommon distemper; an ulcer,
attended with mortifications, violent pains, and the production
of an infinite number of vermin, which devoured
and tormented him day and night. This distemper,
however, seems rather to have been a cancer than a
pestilential disorder, as he laboured under it for more
than a year. After his death, dreadful wars continued,
both by reason of the incursions of barbarians, and the
contests of those who enjoyed, or wished to enjoy, the
empire. The eastern parts, however, had for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
time kept free from pestilential contagion; of which the
christian writers say, that Maximin, who reigned there,
had made his boast; and, being a heathen, ascribed it
to the care he took of preserving the worship of the
gods. But, if this was really the case, he soon found
his gods unable to protect him; for, soon after the accession of
Constantine the great, and his embracing
christianity, the dominions of Maximin were afflicted
with famine accompanied with pestilence, and that attended
by symptoms of a most extraordinary nature;
particularly ulcers about the eyes, which rendered multitudes
of those who were infected with the distemper
totally blind. The christians did not fail to ascribe this
plague to the sins of Maximin; but it must be observed,
that to his other sins he had added that of involving
himself in a violent war, during which the pestilence
broke out, and which probably was one of the causes of
it. We may likewise observe, that if the sins of Maximin
brought on the plague, the piety of Constantine
could not keep it off; since we find that in the year
332, a considerable time after the death of Maximin,
the territories of Constantine were ravaged by a dreadful
plague, and the famine was so severe, that, at Antioch,
wheat was sold at four hundred pieces of silver per
bushel. The distemper which put an end to the life
of Maximin himself was indeed so extraordinary, that
we may reasonably excuse those who called it a judgment
sent directly from heaven. His eyes and tongue
are said to have putrefied; “an invisible fire was kindled
in his bowels, which, being attended with unrelenting
torments, reduced him in a few days to a perfect
skeleton; his whole body was covered over with a
kind of leprosy, and devoured by swarms of vermin;
he could not be prevailed upon to take any nourishment,
but greedily swallowed handfuls of earth, as if
he had hoped by that means to assuage his pains, and
allay the hunger with which he was tormented without
intermission.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> All this, we are told, was the
effect of poison, which he had swallowed in despair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
after being defeated in battle; but the symptoms are
unaccountable.</p>

<p>After the death of Constantine, the empire being
again parted, civil dissensions took place; the northern
barbarians and Persians renewed their incursions, and at
length the battle of Mursa, between the emperor
Constantius and an usurper named Magnentius,
destroyed such numbers that the empire no more
recovered its former strength. From this time therefore
the wars with the barbarians became more and more
violent; and, though frequently overcome, the advantage
was ultimately on their side. In 361, the first year of
the emperor Julian, the pestilence again made its appearance.
It was accompanied by many other grievous calamities:
Dreadful earthquakes were felt in every
province; most of the cities in Palestine, Libya, Sicily
and Greece, were overturned. Libanius writes, that
not one city in Libya was left standing, and but one in
Greece; that Nice was utterly ruined, and Constantinople
greatly damaged. The sea, in several places, broke
in upon the land, and destroyed whole cities with their
inhabitants. At Alexandria, the sea, retiring during an
earthquake, returned again with such violence, that it
drowned several towns and villages in the neighbourhood.
The earthquakes were followed by a famine,
and the famine by a pestilence. It was observed by the
christian writers, that the famine seemed to follow Julian
from place to place: and no wonder that it did so;
for he not only had always a large army along with him,
which consumed great quantities of provision, but, attempting
to remedy the evil by fixing the prices of provisions,
he rendered it much worse, as the dealers in
corn were thereby tempted to convey it to other places<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
Indeed this emperor seems to have been inclined to produce
famines wherever he went; for, on his entering the
territories of the Persians, with whom he was at war, he
wasted the country to such a degree, that he could neither
subsist nor return; while the enemy, imitating his example,
destroyed all before him. The consequence was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
that, by the time Julian was killed, the famine raged in
the Roman camp to such a degree, that not a single person
could have escaped, had not the enemy mercifully
granted them peace.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this dismal situation, we hear of no
plague invading the camp of the Romans at that time.
The wars, however, continued with great violence; and,
in the time of Valentinian, Valens and Gratian, became
worse than ever. The dreadful state of the empire in
the time of Gratian is thus described by St. Jerom:
“The whole country, from Constantinople to the Julian
Alps, has been swimming these twenty years in Roman
blood. Scythia, Thrace, Macedon, Dardania, Dacia,
Thessaly, Achaia, both Epiruses, Dalmatia, both Pannonias,
are filled with Goths, Sarmatians, Quadians,
Alans, Huns, Vandals, Marcomans, &amp;c. whose avarice
nothing has escaped, whose cruelty has been felt by
persons of all ranks, ages and conditions.” “What
evils, (says Gregory Nazianzen) have we not seen or
heard of! Whole countries have been destroyed with
fire and sword; many thousand persons of all ranks
and ages have been inhumanly massacred; the rivers
are still dyed with blood, and the ground covered with
heaps of dead bodies.”</p>

<p>In the midst of so great calamities, the pestilence, as
an evil of inferior nature, might in many cases pass unnoticed
by the historians of the times; nevertheless, even
during that distracted period, we find some accounts of
it. In 384 we are told of a famine and plague at Antioch;
and, in 407, of one in Palestine, said to be occasioned
by multitudes of grasshoppers, which even obscured
the sun, and turned day into night. After having
done incredible mischief, they were thrown by the
wind partly into the Red Sea, and partly into the Mediterranean;
whence being again cast ashore by the waves,
they putrefied, and occasioned a pestilence. Two years
after, when Rome had been first besieged by Alaric the
Goth, the city was reduced to such straits, that human
flesh was publicly sold, and some mothers are said to
have devoured their children. This terrible famine was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
occasioned by the uncultivated state of the country,
which had lain waste for several years, by reason of the
wars, and the ports of Africa being blocked up by Heraclianus
lest an usurper should become emperor; and
thus this loyal admiral, for fear that the people should
have a bad governor, determined rather that there
should be no people to be governed. Notwithstanding
this terrible famine, however, we hear of no pestilential
disorder taking place; not even after the taking of the
city by Alaric, when bloodshed and massacre were added
to the other calamities.</p>

<p>All this time the empire, by the incursions of barbarians,
by usurpations, civil wars, and the general licentiousness
of the people, had been in a situation not to
be described. The invasion of the Hunns, a new and
more formidable enemy than they had ever experienced,
now completed the ruin of the Romans. The whole
western part of the empire became one continued scene
of carnage and desolation. The common epithet bestowed
upon Attila, the king of these barbarians, was,
“The <i>Scourge</i> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the <i>Destroyer</i> of <i>Armies</i>.” As a
specimen of his behaviour, we shall select the account
of his taking of Aquileia in 452. That city, “being
well fortified, and defended by the flower of the Roman
troops, held out, in spite of his utmost efforts, for
three months; at the end of which it was taken by
assault, pillaged for several days together, and laid in
ashes; not a single house being left standing, nor one
person alive that fell into the enemy’s hands. The
cities of Trevigio, Verona, Mantua, Cremona, Brescia
and Bergamo, underwent the same fate; the barbarians
raging every where with such fury as can hardly
be expressed or conceived, and putting all to the
sword, without distinction of sex, age, or condition.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></p>

<p>Every one must own that this was a very effectual
method of preventing the plague in those cities. It did
not, however, prevent that, or some other diseases, from
destroying such numbers of the tyrant’s troops, that he
was for that time prevented from taking Rome itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
From this time, to the total extinction of the western
empire, we do not hear of any remarkable infection
taking place. The barbarians still continued their wars
with one another, while the emperors of Constantinople
were likewise at continual variance with the Persians.
At last, in the year 532, they concluded what they called
a <i>perpetual</i> or <i>eternal</i> peace, which lasted <i>eight years</i>!
Other treaties and truces were concluded; notwithstanding
which, the war was almost continual in the east;
while, by the second conquest of Italy, and the invasion
of the Gothic territories, new desolations overspread the
west. Thus, for a great number of ages, mankind had
been preparing themselves for the dreadful pestilence
which was about to ensue. Whatever infection could
be communicated to the air by multitudes of carcases
rotting above ground had been done in an ample manner.
Whatever debility could be communicated to the
human frame by famine, exposure to the inclemency of
weather, by fatigue, terror, grief, and every thing that
can render life miserable, had also been communicated
by the most powerful means. There only wanted <i>something</i>
to begin the calamity; and this, whatever it was,
took place in the fifteenth year of Justinian. Mr. Gibbon
ascribes the origin of it to locusts; and its universality,
to the general mixture of all nations, and the unrestrained
intercourse they had with one another. “No
restraints (says he) were imposed on the frequent intercourse
of the Roman provinces. From Persia to
France the nations were mingled by wars and emigrations;
and the pestilential odour, which lurks for years
in a bale of cotton, was imported, by the abuse of
trade, into the most distant regions. Procopius relates,
that it spread always from the sea-coast to the inland
countries: the most sequestered islands and mountains
were successively visited; the places which had escaped
the fury of its first passage, were alone exposed to the
contagion of the ensuing year. In time, its malignity
was abated and dispersed; the disease alternately languished
and revived; but it was not till the end of a
calamitous period of fifty-two years, that mankind recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
their health, or the air resumed its pure and
salubrious qualities.”</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Gibbon endeavours to explain the causes
of this plague from an alteration in the salubrity of the
atmosphere, without taking into consideration the dreadful
commotions among mankind, above related. But,
now that we have noticed two very general infections,
one in 767 B.&nbsp;C. the other 1300 years after, we find
them both preceded and accompanied by wars uncommonly
violent and destructive. The great plague in the
time of Justinian is said by Mr. Gibbon to have continued
only fifty-two years; but this we must understand
of its first and most violent attack; for it appears,
from the testimonies produced in the former section,
that pestilential disorders, even very violent ones, continued
at intervals for several centuries. Thus, from
the year 541 to 593, the space of fifty-two years is included;
nevertheless, in the time of Phocas, who began
to reign ten years after, the same calamity continued;
as did also violent wars with the Persians and other barbarians.</p>

<p>The year 622 is remarkable for the flight of Mahomet
from Mecca to Medina, from which time we may
date the rise of the empire of the Saracens; a people
who, for desolation and destruction, were perhaps never
equalled except by the Hunns and Moguls. In 630 the
impostor himself died, after having just united the Arabs
or Saracens, and fitted them for the work in which they
were to be employed. Their first exploit was, to fall
upon the empire of Persia, now weakened by its endless
wars with the Romans. This was conquered in two
years; after which they broke into Palestine, and conquered
the provinces bordering upon Syria. In 634
they reduced Syria itself and Egypt. In 636 they took
and plundered Jerusalem. In 642 they conquered the
African provinces, and reduced some of the islands in
the Levant. With unabated fury they proceeded to
the east and west; laying siege, in 668, to Constantinople
itself, where they received their first check by the
shipwreck of their fleet, and the defeat of their army.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Thus, in the space of 38 years, the immense tract of
country from the eastern part of Persia to the confines
of the Mediterranean Sea, with the northern coasts of
Africa, the whole including a space scarce inferior to the
empire of Alexander the Great, was reduced under
subjection to a race of savage barbarians, who knew only
how to plunder, destroy, and reduce other nations to
slavery.</p>

<p>In this manner were the eastern parts of the world
prepared for a new infection, supposing the old one to
have been entirely gone off. The Saracens pursued
their good fortune, ravaged and conquered from India
to Spain, and from Spain were proceeding northward
through France, to extend their conquests to the other
countries of Europe. But here, in 728, their fury was
stopped by Charles Martel, the father of Pepin, and
grandfather of Charles the Great. After a most obstinate
and bloody battle, which lasted seven days, and in
which the barbarians lost three hundred and seventy-five
thousand men<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> they were driven beyond the Pyrennean
mountains, and never after durst enter France. Thus
was one fury stopped, only to give place to another.
Charles, as ambitious and as cruel as the Saracens, having
in vain attempted the conquest of Spain, reduced Italy
and Germany; and, having dreadfully massacred the
Saxons, and almost exterminated the Hunns, set up the
German Empire, and was crowned emperor of the
West in 800.</p>

<p>While the nations were thus deluging the earth with
blood, the pestilence made its appearance in the east,
attended with extraordinary phenomena<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> Some of these
are taken notice of by the Arabian historians, and others are
mentioned by them, concerning which the Greek histories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
are silent. In 636, particularly, we hear of violent storms
of hail throughout the Arabian Peninsula, and of Syria
being ravaged by epidemic distempers. It would seem,
indeed, that the plague, during the whole of these horrible
periods, had never been extinguished; for in 671
they tell us that a celebrated Arab, named <i>Ziyad</i>, died
of the plague; though neither Greek nor Arabian historians
take notice of any remarkable pestilence as
raging at that time. We are told that this man was
attended by no fewer than <i>an hundred and fifty</i> physicians<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span>
“But, <i>as the decree was sealed</i>, and <i>the thing
determined</i>, they found it impossible to save him.” This
distemper was attended with such an excruciating pain
in his right hand, that the unhappy patient had recourse
to a <i>cadi</i>, or judge, to inform him whether he
might lawfully cut it off. The judge determined that
it was absolutely unlawful to do so; notwithstanding
which, Ziyad resolved to proceed: but his heart failed
him when he saw the instruments and cauterising irons
to be employed in the operation; for in those times of
barbarity and ignorance they knew no other method of
stopping blood but by a hot iron; and therefore some
of the physicians in ancient times, when a limb was to
be cut off, ordered the incision to be made down to the
bone with a red hot razor. But, to return to our subject:
In Syria and Mesopotamia swarms of locusts infected
the earth about the year 679; but, as it seems extremely
probable that the plague was never out of the eastern
regions, we cannot expect to hear much of it, unless
when extremely violent. That in the time of Constantine
Copronymus seems to have extended over Arabia,
as we are told that the Khalif Yezid, who was cotemporary
with Copronymus, died of the plague. We are also
told, that the earthquakes which afflicted the territories
of the Greek emperors extended themselves to the countries
about the Caspian Sea. In those ages indeed the
phenomena of nature appear to have been so extraordinary,
that we can scarcely account them any other than
miraculous. Some of these have been described in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
former section, on the authority of the Greek historians:
the Arabians make mention of others similar. They
tell us, also, that once or twice it rained black stones, and
that some of these were so inflammable, that an Arab
having attempted to make a fire with one of them in his
tent, it burst out into such a violent flame as consumed
the tent altogether<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> This rain may be accounted for
from the explosion of a volcano; but how shall we account
for the sun himself losing his light? a phenomenon
acknowledged even by Mr. Gibbon; though that
author huddles things together in such a manner as
seems totally inconsistent with the regular chain of
events. He tells us, that the dreadful plague, which
broke out in the time of Justinian, was preceded by
comets, and most violent earthquakes; and that these
comets were attended with an extraordinary paleness of
the sun. This may be; but the word <i>paleness</i> cannot
apply to the <i>darkness</i> which lasted from the fourth of
August to the first of October, and to which he seems
to allude, though it happened long after the time of
Justinian; neither can it be applied to what I am now
about to relate, viz. that in the year 782, a little after
sunrise, the solar light was lost without an eclipse, and
the darkness continued till noon. It is impossible to
read the histories of those times without remembering
the words of our Saviour, that there should be signs in
the sun and in the moon, distress and perplexity of nations,
the sea and waves roaring, men’s hearts failing
them for fear, &amp;c. But, however the God of nature
might thus intimate to mankind his displeasure with
their proceedings, it is certain they made no alteration
in their conduct. The Saracens, having conquered immense
tracts of country, engaged in civil wars among
themselves; the western nations, after having tried in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
vain to destroy each other, at last united in a romantic
design of conquering Palestine from the Infidels; while
the Turks, leaving their habitations about Mount Caucasus,
where, like the vultures of Prometheus, they had
for ages remained unseen and unknown, precipitated
themselves upon the Greeks and Saracens, and lastly, as
if all hell had broke loose at once, the Moguls, from the
most easterly part of Asia, poured destruction upon the
countries to the west, even as far as Russia and Poland.</p>

<p>All these events took place in a few centuries. In
844 the Turks quitted Mount Caucasus, and settled in
Armenia Major. In 1030 they fell upon the Saracen
empire, now divided among innumerable chieftains continually
at war with each other. Among these was one
called the Sultan of Persia, and another of Babylon.
The former being worsted, called in the Turks to his
assistance. They sent him an auxiliary army of only
<i>three thousand</i> men; and from this slender beginning has
arisen the vast empire of the Ottoman Porte. The
three thousand men were commanded by a general called
by the Greeks <i>Tangrolipix</i>, and by the Asiatics <i>Togrul
Beg</i>. Being a man of ability, the Sultan of Persia, by
his assistance, got the better of his adversary; but, refusing
to let the Turks depart, Tangrolipix with his army
withdrew to the desert of Carbonitis, where, being joined
by numbers of discontented Persians, he began to invade
the territories of the Saracens. The Sultan of Persia
sent against him an army of twenty thousand men, whom
Tangrolipix surprised and defeated, acquiring at the
same time an immense booty. The fame of his victory,
and his wealth, procured him bands of robbers, thieves,
and blackguards, from all the neighbouring countries;
so that he soon found himself at the head of fifty thousand.
Against such a formidable force the Sultan of
Persia marched in person; but happening to lose his
life in the engagement by a fall from his horse, his men
threw down their arms and acknowledged Tangrolipix
to be Sultan of Persia.</p>

<p>The new sultan instantly thought of destroying other
sultans and potentates; for which purpose he opened a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
passage for his countrymen from Armenia to Persia.
The Sultan of Babylon was the first victim; after which
Tangrolipix turned his arms unsuccessfully against the
Arabians, but afterwards more successfully against the
Greek emperors. The first invasion by the Turks took
place in 1041; and in four hundred and twelve years
they became absolute masters of the empire. Though
unsuccessful at first against the Saracens, they prevailed
greatly afterwards, and, by the time of the crusades, we
find them masters of Palestine, as well as several other
countries formerly conquered by the Arabs. From the
time of their first invasion, in 1041, we may say, the war
never ceased; and there is the greatest reason to suppose
that the Greek empire would have been overthrown in
a very short time, had not the crusaders checked their
progress. The immense numbers with whom the barbarians
had now to contend (amounting to no fewer
than seven hundred thousand) threatened with destruction
the newly erected empire of the Turks; and had it
not been for the want of unanimity among the crusaders
themselves, and the jealousy of the emperors of Constantinople,
they certainly would have overthrown it.
But, as matters went, all their labour was lost; and they
only increased the general carnage and desolation to an
extreme degree. The first crusade was planned in
1093, published in 1095, and in March 1096 the first
army set out. In 1097 they began their conquests, but
soon found it very difficult to keep them. The Turks
being at home, and united, had many advantages over
foreign invaders; which the latter endeavoured to
counteract by drawing continual supplies of fresh men
from Europe. Thus, for several centuries, the western
part of Asia was rendered a scene of bloodshed and desolation.
When they had contended for something more
than <i>two hundred</i> years, Jenghiz Khan, the Mogul, seems
to have formed the <i>noble</i> design of destroying the whole
human race at once, excepting only his own immediate
followers. His plan was, to <i>exterminate</i> man, woman
and child wherever he went, and to plant the countries
with his own people. It is impossible to do justice to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
his exploits. Voltaire, speaking of the irruption of the
Moguls, says, that the people fled every where before
them, like wild beasts roused from their dens by other
beasts more savage than themselves. In the Universal
History we are told, that he is supposed to have destroyed
<i>fourteen millions and an half</i> of his fellow creatures. He
died in 1227, and left successors worthy of himself.
Some of these proceeded eastward, and some westward.
The latter, under the conduct of a <i>monster</i> named <i>Hula-ku</i>,
overthrew, in the year 1256, the remains of the
Saracen empire, by the taking of Bagdad. The miserable
Khalif, coming forth to meet his conqueror, was
trampled under his horse’s feet, then sewed up in a sack,
dragged through the streets, and thrown into the river.
The Moguls who proceeded eastward invaded China.
The Chinese resisted with innumerable multitudes, and
battles were fought to which those of the present age are
mere skirmishes. The soldiers, overcome with thirst,
drank blood instead of water; hundreds of thousands
fell on both sides, while human blood ran in streams for
five or six miles. At last the fury of the Moguls was
stopped by the ocean; for, having attempted the conquest
of Japan, their fleet was wrecked, and an hundred
thousand perished. Like other great empires, also, pretenders
to the sovereignty started up, and the whole was
parcelled out into a number of little states, which, of
course, ceased to be formidable.</p>

<p>The decline of the Mogul empire did not restore
peace to the world. The Turks continued their ravages;
the western nations continued their crusades. England,
which became a kingdom in 800, had been ravaged and
conquered by the Danes and Normans, and likewise distressed
by civil wars. At last, having emerged from its
own difficulties, it began to inflict upon other nations
the miseries itself had endured. Wales and Scotland
became objects of the ambition of Edward I, who had
already signalized his valour in the crusade. The
Welsh were totally subjugated, and the Scots overthrown
in the very bloody battle of Falkirk, where almost the
whole force of the country was destroyed. The Scots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
however, were never totally subdued. Robert Bruce
retaliated on the English in the battle of Bannock-burn,
where two hundred thousand English were defeated by
thirty thousand Scots. But Robert was not contented
with asserting the liberty of his country. Jealous of
his brother Edward, he sent him with an army to
conquer Ireland. We shall not doubt of his valour, or
of the miseries he inflicted, or was willing to inflict, upon
the people among whom he came. In destroying them
he destroyed his own army. They were reduced to the
most dreadful straits by famine, insomuch that they
were obliged to feed upon the most loathsome matters,
their own excrements not excepted.</p>

<p>Being now arrived at the beginning of the fourteenth
century, we see that, from Ireland to China, mankind
had involved themselves in one general work of destruction.
Besides the wars, famines had been so frequent,
that the eating of one another seemed to be but
a common affair. Indeed the history of mankind would
tempt one to believe that they thought themselves
brought into the world for no other purpose but to destroy
each other. As far back as the year 409, in the
time of the wars of the Vandals in Spain, a dreadful
famine took place, which, in 410, reduced many to the
necessity of feeding upon human flesh; parents devoured
their children, and the wild beasts, being deprived of the
dead bodies which they used to feed upon, but which
were at this time devoured by the living, fell upon the
latter, and thus increased the general destruction. Such
of the Romans as fled into strong holds and fortresses,
were in the end obliged to feed upon one another. To
these calamities the pestilence was added, which did not
fail to rage in its usual manner. Famine and pestilence
had also ravaged the city of Rome when besieged by the
Goths under Vitiges, and under Totila. In this last
siege the unhappy citizens were reduced to such straits,
that they consumed even the grass which grew near the
walls, and were at last obliged to feed on their own excrements.
We do not indeed hear, at this time, of any
particular instances of people feeding upon one another;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
though, in such dreadful emergences, it is scarcely to be
doubted that some would have recourse to this terrible
expedient in order to allay their hunger. But in the
famines which took place during the ravages of the Saracens,
Turks and Moguls, nothing seems to have been
more common. In 1066 a most grievous famine took
place at Alexandria in Egypt, and throughout the whole
country. Three bushels and a half of flour were sold at
eighty dinars, a dog at five, and a cat at three. The
Visir, having waited on the Khalif, left his horse at the
palace gate; but, before he returned, the animal had
been carried off and eaten. Three men were hanged
for this theft, and their bodies ordered to be exposed
upon gibbets; but next day they were found picked to
the bones, their flesh having been all cut off and devoured
the preceding night. Bodies of men and women
were boiled, and their flesh publicly sold. A violent
plague followed, which swept away the greatest part of
the inhabitants. As the hellish Moguls spread desolation
wherever they advanced, so their retreats were
equally formidable. In 1243, having advanced as far
as Aleppo in Syria, they found themselves obliged to
retreat, and that for a very odd reason, viz. that their
horses were not well shod. This, however, did not hinder
them from destroying every thing the earth produced,
and stripping every man, nay, every woman,
they met, even of their clothes. The consequence was,
a terrible famine, so that people were fain to sell their
children for small pieces of bread.</p>

<p>Such was the conduct of men, from one end of the
earth to the other, during the interval, if any interval
there was, between the plague in the time of Justinian
and that of 1346. The pestilence, which had continually
raged in one place or other, now overspread the
whole world. At what time it began to decline we
know not; and, indeed, as the same desolations and
massacres continued, if these had any share in its production,
it ought scarcely to have declined at all. That
there was all this time little or no interval, appears from
what Dr. Rush says, vol.&nbsp;iii. p.&nbsp;165, that between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
years 1006 and 1680, that is, in a period of 674 years,
the plague was <i>fifty-two</i> times epidemic all over Europe.
Supposing the intervals between every general infection
then to have been equal, and the plague to have lasted
only one year at a time, it must have recurred once in
twelve years. But the intervals were not equal; for
the Doctor tells us that it prevailed <i>fourteen</i> times in
the fourteenth century; which gives an interval of less
than seven years; and if the pestilence so frequently overspread
the whole continent, we may be very sure that it
never was out of particular places of it. The Doctor
adds, “The state of Europe in this long period is well
known.” We shall also consider that of Asia.</p>

<p>The empire of the Moguls, which had fallen into
decay, revived under Tamerlane; who, following the
example of Jenghiz Khan, had the epithet of the
<i>destroying prince</i> bestowed upon him by the Indians, on
account of his behaviour in their country. Building
his captives into walls with stones and lime, pounding
them by thousands in large mortars, was his common
practice; while the Turks, proceeding westward, wasted
every thing with fire and sword; the christians all the
while continuing their mad crusades, and when driven
from one place endeavouring to establish themselves in
another. At last the Turks and Tartars, or Moguls, or
rather their emperors, happening to quarrel, the battle
of Angora, in Galatia, decided (at the expense of some
hundred thousand lives) the dispute in favour of Tamerlane;
but, as his empire ended with his life, the Turks
soon recovered from the blow they had received; and,
by the taking of Constantinople in 1453, put an end to
the terrible commotions which had prevailed in the east
for so many ages. The crusades had also for some time
been discontinued, and the world hath since that time
been comparatively in a state of peace.</p>

<p>But, by so much intercourse with the Asiatics, especially
with the countries particularly subject to the
plague, all Europe had been so deeply infected, that the
distemper could not but prevail for a long time, even
though it had not been kept up by the almost continual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
wars of the Europeans with one another, which was too
much the case. Dr. Sydenham informs us that before
his time the plague commonly visited England once in
forty years; but by this we must understand a very violent
infection; for Dr. Rush tells us that plagues prevailed
in London <i>every year</i> from 1593 to 1611, and
from 1636 to 1649. The author of the Journal of the
Plague Year (1665) mentions a visitation in 1656; and
Mr. Carey, in the beginning of his account of the plague
of London in 1665, says, that the plague was <i>almost
continually</i> among the diseases enumerated in their bills
of mortality; so that we may fairly conclude it to have
been <i>endemic</i> in that city. Now let us see how England
had employed itself. Its kings, as well as many of
their subjects, had gone to the holy wars, as they called
them, and, by continuing in that devoted country
where most probably the pestilence first originated, it is
impossible to suppose that some of them did not receive
the contagion. Having caught the pestilence in the
<i>holy war</i>, they came home to diffuse it among their
countrymen, and to keep it up by <i>profane wars</i>, I suppose,
both foreign and domestic. Henry VII put an
end to a very long and bloody contest between the
houses of York and Lancaster; but he brought the
pestilence along with him, which raged violently during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A most violent
war, for half a century, on the continent of Europe, and
civil wars in England, would still continue to keep the
infection alive from 1600 to 1648, when a general peace
was concluded; and from the subsequent state of tranquillity,
probably, after the violent attack in 1665, it
seems to have languished and died in England, as a
plant in a soil not natural to it.</p>

<p>But, though England has since remained in peace, on
the continent it has been otherwise. In the beginning
of the eighteenth century, the heroic madness of Charles
XII seemed ready to confound the north, while the
glorious exploits of prince Eugene and the duke of
Marlborough appeared equally confounding to France.
In the midst of these grand atchievments, the pestilence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
silently claimed its share in the common work of destruction;
carrying off upwards of two thousand in a
week for some time, in 1709, in the city of Dantzick,
and, in 1711, twenty-five out of sixty thousand inhabitants
in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The infection, however, seemed now to be retiring to
the place from whence it originally came. In 1666, or
soon after, it seems to have totally abandoned the island
of Britain; with the attack in 1711 it left the western
countries of the continent next to that island; in 1713,
1714 and 1715 we are informed by baron Van Swieten
that it ravaged Austria; in 1721, or soon after, it abandoned
France; in 1743 it made its last attack on Messina;
and in 1784 we find it confined to Dalmatia and
the eastern territories, where it has so long reigned without
interruption.</p>

<p>From the view then which we have taken of the conduct
of the human race, and the consequences of that
conduct, we may reasonably conclude, that war will produce
famine and pestilence, and that after all violent
wars a violent pestilence may be expected, especially if
the contending parties interfere with those nations
where it is most frequent. Another piece of conduct
by which mankind expose themselves to pestilential contagions
is, the practice of cooping themselves up in great
cities. Mr. Gibbon, speaking of earthquakes, says, that
men, though always complaining, frequently bring mischief
upon themselves. “The institution of great cities
(adds he) which enclose a nation within the limits
of a wall, almost realises the wish of Caligula, that the
Roman people had but one neck. In these disasters
(earthquakes) the architect becomes the enemy
of mankind. The hut of a savage, or the tent of an
Arab, is thrown down without injury to the inhabitant;
and the Peruvians had reason to deride the
folly of the Spanish conquerors, who with so much
cost and care erected their own sepulchres. The rich
marbles of a palace are dashed on its owner’s head, a
whole people is buried under the ruins of public or
private edifices, and the conflagration is kindled and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
propagated by innumerable fires necessary for the
subsistence and manufactures of a great city.” In
plagues, great cities are unquestionably as pernicious as
in earthquakes; not indeed by reason of the weight and
bulk of the materials, but the confinement of the people
within the sphere of infection, and their continual
exposure to the causes which prepare the body for receiving
it. In fact, it has always been found that
plagues begin in cities; and were it not for the multitudes
that continually fly out of them there can be no
doubt that the mortality would be much greater than it
is. The intercourse of many nations with one another,
the carrying from one end of the earth to the other of
goods capable of bringing with them the infection, must
also be supposed a very principal cause of pestilence;
but this last will be more fully considered in the next
section. At present we may conclude, that, the pestilential
contagion having originally fallen upon mankind
for their sins, it is still kept alive by the same causes;
and, as far as we can conjecture, these sins are, the propensity
to murder and destroy which breaks forth in
war; the vanity, pride and luxury which produces great
cities; and the same vanity, &amp;c. joined with avarice,
which gives life to commerce. Add to all this the neglect
of the cultivation of the earth, which ought to be
the principal business of man. In consequence of this
neglect, immense tracts of it are still overrun with
woods, covered with stagnant and noxious waters, or
lying in waste and now uninhabitable deserts, fit only
for serpents and the most destructive animals. Thus the
very climate is changed from what it ought to be; the
elements become hostile to man in an extreme degree,
and the whole system of nature, originally designed to
give life and happiness to the human race, is, through
their own misconduct, changed into a system of misery,
disease and death.</p>

<p>The account just now given of the ways in which
mankind bring upon themselves the plague, and other
diseases almost equally terrible, is so conformable to the
opinions of the learned Dr. Mead, that I shall conclude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
this section with a few extracts from his works. Of the
small pox he says, that he supposes this “to be a plague
of its own kind, originally bred in Africa, and more
especially in Ethiopia, as the heat is excessive there;
and thence, like the true plague, was brought into
Arabia and Egypt, after the manner above mentioned”
(i. e. by war and merchandise.) “Now (adds
he) if any one should wonder why this contagion was
so long confined to its native soil, without spreading
into distant countries, I pray him to consider, that
foreign commerce was much more sparingly carried on
in ancient times than in our days, especially between
Mediterranean nations; and likewise that the ancients
seldom or never undertook long voyages by sea, as we
do. And Ludolfus observes, that the Ethiopians in
particular were ignorant of mercantile affairs. Therefore
when in process of time the mutual intercourse of
different nations became more frequent by wars, trade
and other causes, this contagious disease was spread
far and wide. But, towards the end of the eleventh
century, and beginning of the twelfth, it gained vast
ground by means of the wars waged by a confederacy
of christian powers against the Saracens, for the recovery
of the Holy Land; this being the only visible
recompense of their religious expeditions, which they
brought back to their respective countries.” Of the
true plague he says, “It appears, I think, very plainly,
that the plague is a real poison, which, being bred in
the southern parts of the world, is carried by commerce
into other parts of the world, particularly into
Turky, where it maintains itself by a kind of circulation
from persons to goods; which is chiefly owing
to the negligence of the people there, who are stupidly
careless in the affair: that, when the constitution
of the air happens to favour infection, it rages there
with great violence; that at that time, more especially,
diseased persons give it to one another, and from them
contagious matter is lodged in goods of a soft, loose
texture, which, being packed up and carried into other
countries, let out, when opened, the imprisoned seeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
of the contagion, and produce the disease whenever the
air is disposed to give them force; otherwise they may
be dissipated without any considerable ill effects. The
air of our climate is so far from being ever the original
of the true plague, that most probably it never produces
those milder infectious distempers, the small pox and
measles. For these diseases were not heard of in
Europe before the Moors had entered Spain; and, as
already observed, they were afterwards propagated and
spread through all nations, chiefly by means of the
wars with the Saracens. The sweating sickness was
most probably of foreign original. It began in the
army with which king Henry VII came from France,
and landed in Wales; and it has been supposed by
some to have been brought from the famous siege of
Rhodes, three or four years before, as may be collected
from one place of what Dr. Keyes says in his treatise
on the disease. We had here the same kind of fever
in 1713, about the month of September, which was
called the <i>Dunkirk fever</i>, is being brought by our
soldiers from that place. This, probably, had its original
from the plague which broke out at Dantzick a
few years before, and continued some time among the
cities of the north.”</p>

<p>I now take leave, for the present, of this subject,
which exhibits the conduct of mankind in such a disagreeable
view. Some, like M. Millot above quoted,
may be apt to suppose that many of the accounts are
exaggerated. But it is evident, that in our days it is
impossible to determine any thing to be a falsehood, said
to have happened in former ages, which is not absolutely
contradictory to reason. Every one of the accounts inserted
in this section has found a place in the works of
historians reckoned authentic, particularly in the Universal
History. All who believe the New Testament
must certainly believe, from the words of our Saviour,
that extraordinary things were to happen in the ages
subsequent to his appearance. Can we then discredit
the relations of those historians who inform us that extraordinary
things have happened? Modern historians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
making their own judgments the infallible measure of wisdom,
and the strength of nations now existing the ultimate
measure of human power, have endeavoured to
turn into ridicule every thing which does not precisely
accord with these two. In this the French are particularly
culpable; accounting every thing to be incredible
which exceeds the power of modern France to accomplish,
though they certainly do not know even the
extent of this power. Of such scandalous vanity we
have a notable instance in the works of president Goguet,
who positively determines that the walls of ancient Babylon,
the pyramids of Egypt, and all the wonderful
works of Semiramis, Nebuchadnezzar, &amp;c. were not
equal to the canal of Languedoc made by Louis XIV!</p>

<p class="dropcap">H<span class="ls01em">ITHERTO</span> we have considered the origin of the
plague entirely in a moral point of view. We
have seen, that, in conformity to the general opinion of
mankind, it may reasonably be supposed to have been
inflicted upon mankind, the Jews particularly, for their
transgressions; that, having been once introduced, it
has been perpetuated, and spread from nation to nation,
and that in proportion to the degree of immorality of
a certain kind prevailing through the world. From
this it is naturally to be inferred, that, were the human
race to live at peace with one another, to disperse themselves
over the face of the earth for the purpose of
improving it by cultivation, and were they to be contented
with what the produce of each country affords,
there would be no plague among them. But we know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
that such a reformation is not to be expected, and we
must take the world as we find it. The question then
is, By what means shall individuals secure themselves
from being destroyed by a plague which shall happen to
invade any country; or how shall a person, already
infected with it, be restored to health? For this purpose
let us begin with considering the nature of disease in
general, and of the plague particularly.</p>

<p>As to disease in general, physicians have differed very
considerably in their definitions; and, though many
have been given, few seem to be unexceptionable. That
of Dr. Fordyce seems to be among the clearest and
most expressive. “Disease (says he) is such an alteration
in the chemical properties of the fluids or
solids, or of their organization, or of the action of
the moving powers, as produces an inability or difficulty
of performing the functions of the whole or any
part of the system, or pain, or preternatural evacuation.”
But as this definition, however just, cannot
be easily understood by such as are unaccustomed to
medical language, I shall attempt the following explanation
of the animal economy, and the diseases to
which it is subject.</p>

<p>1. By nature our bodies are formed of certain solid
and fluid parts, operating upon one another in a manner
of which we know but little. Anatomists have described
the structure of the human body and its parts in
a certain degree, but have always found themselves
lost in an inconceivable minuteness of texture. The
whole structure of the human body, visible and invisible,
is called its <span class="lowercase smcap">ORGANIZATION</span>.</p>

<p>2. This organized body is acted upon by certain
powers residing in the atmosphere, by which it becomes
endowed with <span class="lowercase smcap">LIFE</span>.</p>

<p>3. The operation of those powers upon a well organized
body constitutes that agreeable and vigorous state
which we call <span class="lowercase smcap">HEALTH</span>.</p>

<p>4. The operation of any other power, substituted in
place of the natural one, even upon a body perfectly
organized, produces a state very different from health;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
commonly attended with some uneasy sensations, and
which is called <span class="lowercase smcap">DISEASE</span>. I say it is <i>commonly</i> attended
with uneasiness, but not always; for many persons
within a few hours, nay, a few minutes, of their death,
have imagined themselves quite recovered and well.
To illustrate the meaning of what is said of the substitution
of any power instead of the natural one: It is
natural for man to breathe air of a certain quality; and
while he does so he continues in health; but let him
breathe the vapour of burning charcoal, or of fermenting
liquor, mixed in considerable quantity with the air to
which he has been accustomed, and he will very soon
find himself diseased. Many other kinds of elastic
fluids may be substituted instead of the vapour just
mentioned, all of which will in a short time produce a
disease in the most healthy man. The state of a diseased
body being very different from that of a sound
one, the appearances are consequently very different.
The various appearances of disease in the human body
are called <i>symptoms</i> of that disease, from a Greek word
signifying <i>appearance</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span></p>

<p>5. A disease proves mortal only by the <span class="lowercase smcap">DISORGANIZATION</span>
of the body. By disorganization I mean any
considerable alteration in the structure of the body, visible
or invisible. The truth of this will appear from
a consideration of the method by which animals may be
recovered, after being to appearance dead by breathing
the vapour of charcoal, or fixed air in any other form,
viz. by plunging them in cold water. In a cave in
Italy a continual stream of this kind of air issues from
the ground. It rises but a small way, so that a man
may safely enter, because his head is above the vapour;
but, if he brings a small dog with him, the animal, in
consequence of breathing the pernicious fluid, falls down
as if dead, and would very soon die if left there. By
throwing it into a lake in the neighbourhood, (cold
water of any kind would answer as well) it recovers. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the dissection of some unfortunate people, who have
been killed by breathing this pernicious fume, a manifest
disorganization has been observed, viz. a rarefaction
of the blood, and too great dilation, or even rupture, of
the small vessels.</p>

<p>6. A disease cannot always be cured by removing the
cause which brought it on: it is necessary also to repair
the injury done to the organization. This is exemplified
in the case of the dog just mentioned. Taking
him out of the vapour is not sufficient for his recovery,
because the organization of the body is injured; the
cold water by contracting the vessels repairs the injury,
and the cure is completed. To the entire preservation
of this organization it is probably owing, that people
have frequently recovered after being thought dead for
a long time<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>7. When the organization of the body is injured, the
action of the natural powers themselves occasions uneasiness,
and increases the disease. The cure then is, to
substitute instead of the natural power, as far as possible,
the action of some other power till the organization
is restored; after which the natural power must be
again allowed to act, or a disease of another kind will
take place. This may be exemplified in a consumption
of the lungs; where, that part being very much disorganized,
pure air renders the disease worse; and the
sick are relieved by mixing with the common atmosphere
such kinds of air or vapour as would prove pernicious
to people in health. But, supposing this method
to be successful, and the consumption to be entirely
removed, it is plain that the use of the pure atmosphere
must be resumed, or the impure air would bring on a
disease in the same manner as on a healthy person.</p>

<p>8. The body is wasted in the natural operations of
life; part of it passing off with the vapour of the breath,
part by insensible perspiration, &amp;c. Hence it naturally
tends to disorganization and death, unless the waste be
repaired.</p>

<p>9. This natural waste of the body is repaired, and
health kept up, by the food and drink taken into the
stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>10. Hence arises another set of diseases; for as the
reparation of the waste, just mentioned, depends on the
proper action of the stomach upon the food, and the
assimilation of the latter with the substance of the body,
it is plain that this operation depends both on the
proper quality of the food, and the sound state of the
stomach itself.</p>

<p>11. The body is composed of solids and fluids of different
kinds, every one of which is subject to diseases
peculiar to itself; but, by reason of the connexion of
the parts of the body with one another, it is impossible
that any one can be very much disordered without affecting
all the rest. As the bond of connexion, however,
is in many cases totally invisible to us, surprising
instances frequently occur of one part being affected in
consequence of an injury done to another very distant
from it. This connexion between all parts of the
body is called <span class="lowercase smcap">SYMPATHY</span>. Dr. Gardiner of Edinburgh,
in his observations on the animal economy, &amp;c.
says, that “the stomach is the principal seat of many of
the most remarkable sympathetic affections which
happen in valetudinary states of the body. Every
disorder accompanied with severe pain affects the stomach,
whilst this viscus affects not only in its diseased
state every part of the system, but at other
times the effects of healthful stimuli applied to it are
instantly communicated to the rest of the body, as
when we take food, wine, or medicine.” Dr. Darwin
in his Zoonomia informs us that the stomach is said to
sympathize with almost every part of the body; but Dr.
Moore, in his medical sketches, tells us that the <i>heart</i>
possesses a greater share of sympathy than any other part
in the body, and next to it the stomach<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>
<p>12. The solid parts of the body are the bones, the
muscles, brain and nerves; the fluids are, the blood,
and others produced from it. The bones are known to
every one; the muscles are the fleshy parts throughout
the whole body; and the nerves are a kind of cords
seemingly originating from the brain, and from thence
accompanying the blood vessels through all parts of
the body.</p>

<p>13. Much has been disputed about what is to be
accounted the primary part of the body, on which all
the rest depend; and one class of disputants have arranged
themselves on the side of the <i>blood</i>, and the other
on that of the <i>nerves</i>. The dispute is like one about
the beginning of a circle. It cannot be decided, because
the blood cannot act without nerves, nor the
nerves without blood. I speak of the human body,
being aware that in some animals the position may be
controverted. The following is a concise state of the
matter.</p>

<p>14. All the blood in the body passes through the
heart; which has four cavities; two called <i>ventricles</i>,
and two <i>auricles</i>. These, from their position in the body,
are called the <i>right</i> and <i>left</i>. The right ventricle communicates
with the right auricle, as does also the left
ventricle with the left auricle; but there is no communication
between the right ventricle and the left, nor
between the right auricle and the left. Through these
cavities all the blood passes to every part of the body,
and returns from every part; but, as in the former case,
we are here at a great loss where to begin its motion;
for this is precisely to find the beginning of a circle.
As we must begin somewhere, however, we shall do so
with the right ventricle of the heart. This receives the
blood returning from all parts of the body, and propels
it into the right ventricle; not the whole quantity at
once, for it cannot contain one half of it; but by degrees.
The auricle contracts as soon as it is full; and
in the time that the auricle fills, the ventricle contracts,
so that it may be empty, and ready to receive the blood
from the auricle. By the contraction of the right ventricle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the blood is driven into the pulmonary artery, and
passes into the lungs. Here the artery branches into an
infinite number of small vessels much finer than hairs;
and these again, uniting into larger trunks, form at last
the pulmonary vein, which brings back the blood to
the heart. The pulmonary vein is inserted into the
left auricle of the heart, which, as soon as it is filled with
blood, contracts, and expels the blood from it into the
left ventricle. From the left ventricle issues a large
artery called the <i>aorta</i>, which by its branches supplies
the whole body with the vital fluid. In all parts of the
body the arteries divide themselves into innumerable
small branches, which terminate in veins equally small
as in the lungs; but it has been disputed whether the
arteries and veins actually join each other in the form of
vessels, or whether the arteries deposit the blood in small
cells, from which the veins suck it up. The dispute is
of no consequence, nor can it be absolutely decided, on
account of the exceeding smallness of the vessels;
though the microscopical observations are rather favourable
to the opinion of a continuation of vessels. The
veins from all parts of the body unite into larger vessels,
and these again uniting with one another, form at last
one very large vein called the vena cava, which opens
into the right auricle of the heart, from which the circulation
goes on as already described. The two ventricles
of the heart, and all the veins throughout the body,
are furnished with a kind of valves, which allow the
blood to proceed in the way of circulation, but prevent
its returning in a contrary direction.</p>

<p>15. The lungs, through which all the blood in the
body passes, receive likewise the air which we draw in
every time we breathe. They consist of two large bodies
called <i>lobes</i>; from their situation called the right
and left. The air is conveyed into them by the wind-pipe,
called also the <i>trachea</i>, and the <i>aspera arteria</i>. On
entering the cavity of the breast, the wind-pipe divides
into two large branches called the <i>bronchiæ</i>; one of
which goes to the right and the other to the left lobe of
the lungs. By the further division and subdivision of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
these vessels the lungs are filled with an innumerable
multitude of little tubes, terminating in exceedingly
minute bladders or cells, which are the final receptacles
of the air sucked in when we breathe. Each of these
cells is surrounded with a kind of network of blood-vessels
exceedingly small, and consisting of very thin membranes;
so that, in passing through the lungs, the blood
is exposed as much as possible to the action of the air.</p>

<p>16. It is a matter of great importance to find out
what is the use of this exposure of the blood; and
great disputes have taken place concerning it. In former
times it was supposed that the blood received from
the air a <i>vital spirit</i>, without which it would have been
totally incapable of performing its offices in the body.
Later physiologists endeavoured to explode this notion.
Dr. Hales particularly, by shewing that the circulation
of the blood through the lungs might be continued by
inflating and contracting them alternately by the fumes
of burning brimstone, endeavoured to prove that the use
of the air was only to give the lungs an opportunity of
dilating and contracting alternately, by which means
principally he thought the circulation might be carried
on. This continued to be the most common hypothesis
as late as the time of Dr. Huxham. It was however
thought also that by the compression of the air the
blood was altered in its texture, its bulk, &amp;c. Accordingly
Dr. Huxham tells us in the preface to his treatise
on air and epidemic diseases, that “air fit for respiration
ought neither to be too hot, nor very cold; for the
use of the inspired air is to temperate the blood, which
would otherwise grow too hot, and putrefy, as is evident
from the experiment of the most excellent Boerhaave
made in a hot house; for, if the air is more hot,
or even equally hot, as the blood of any animal, it certainly
soon dies.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></p>

<p>17. The modern discoveries in the composition of air,
have tended greatly to elucidate the use of this fluid in
the lungs, and its action on the blood in respiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
Dr. Priestly first determined it to be what he terms a
<i>phlogistic process</i>, i. e. a process by which the parts of the
blood no longer proper to be retained among the rest, or
at least some of them, are carried off. That <i>something</i> is
carried off either from the lungs themselves, or from the
blood circulating through them, is evident; for the air
which is taken into the lungs in a dry state, comes out
of them extremely moist, and loaded with vapour. An
essential change is also made in the nature of the air itself;
for it now assumes in a great measure the nature
of what has been called fixed air, or the fume of charcoal,
or fermenting liquor, and thus becomes unfit for
being breathed a second time. This change is made by
the addition of some terrestrial substance to the pure
atmosphere, which the latter volatilizes and carries along
with it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p>18. But, whatever may be <i>carried off</i> from the blood,
during its passage through the lungs, something is certainly
<i>added</i> to it, for the blood in the pulmonary artery
is of a dark red, but when it has undergone the action
of the air in the lungs, and returns by the pulmonary
vein, it is then of a bright scarlet, which colour it retains
through all the arteries of the body, but loses it on its
return through the veins. This scarlet colour is communicated
to blood in all cases when exposed to the
air; and Dr. Priestley has observed that it is acted upon
by the air even through a bladder; much more then
must it be so through those very thin membranes which
form the coats of the fine pulmonary vessels. What
this subtile matter is which the blood receives, shall be
afterwards inquired into; at present it is sufficient to
take notice that it is absolutely necessary, for the purposes
of life, that the blood should pass through the
lungs: for, as Dr. Huxham observes, “we see neither
nutrition, nor the motion of the muscles, performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
by any blood that hath not passed through the lungs;
this is observable from the coronary <span class="nowrap">arteries<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> to the
ultimate ramifications of the aorta.” As the previous
circulation of the blood through the lungs therefore is
absolutely necessary to the growth and life of the body,
and as the blood certainly receives <i>something</i> from the
air, we must account this a proof, and no inconsiderable
one, that the air contains a <i>vital spirit</i>, which it imparts
to the blood in the lungs. But, before we proceed farther
on this subject, it is proper to take some notice of</p>

<p>19. <i>The nerves.</i> These, which constitute such a remarkable
and important part of the human body, are
white cords, of a soft pulpy substance, defended by a
tough skin which goes along with them as far as they
can be traced. All the nerves either originate from the
brain, or terminate in it. The former doctrine hath
been generally adopted, and in conformity to that doctrine
the following account of the nerves is laid down.
The brain is enclosed in the cavity of the scull, but not
without the intervention of two membranes, called the
<i>dura</i> and <i>pia mater</i>, to prevent injury from the hard
bones, as well as for other purposes. The brain is divided
into two lobes, the right and left. It is composed of
two different kinds of substance, the outermost called
the cortical, the innermost the medullary substance; the
latter seems composed of fine fibres. The whole of the
medullary part of the brain terminates in a substance
called the <i>cerebellum</i>, very much resembling the brain,
but smaller. The cerebellum terminates in another
substance resembling the medullary part of the brain,
called the <i>medulla oblongata</i>. The cerebellum lies in the
back part of the head, and the medulla oblongata under
it. The latter terminates in the spinal marrow, extending
from the lower and back part of the head to the
lower extremity of the back bone, and is enclosed in the
hollow of that bone. The nerves proceed from these
four substances, viz. the brain, the cerebellum, the medulla
oblongata, and spinal marrow. As they pass to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
parts of the body they accompany the arteries, dividing
with them into innumerable small branches; but they
do not return with the veins; so that they seem not to
contain any fluid which goes and comes, or which circulates
like the blood. The nervous fluid, if any such
there be, seems to move constantly one way, either to
the brain or from it.</p>

<p>20. Hitherto we have noticed only things which are
evident to our senses, and which the industry of anatomists
has abundantly evinced; but now our subject renders
it necessary to step aside a little into the obscure
regions of theory and conjecture. The muscles, as we
have formerly said, are the fleshy parts of the body; and
by them all the motions of the body are performed.
The flesh is distributed into distinct portions, each of
which is enclosed in a membrane belonging to itself.
Each of these portions is a muscle, and each muscle has
a branch of an artery and the branch of a nerve belonging
to it. On both these the action of the muscle depends;
for, if we cut the nerve belonging to a muscle,
it immediately loses all power of action; and if we cut
the artery which accompanies the nerve, it does the
same. As therefore the blood is found to receive <i>something</i>
from the air, and as it loses this when passing
through the arteries, and as the nerves lose their power
when the communication with the blood is cut off, it
seems extremely probable, that what is imbibed by the
blood in the lungs is taken up by the fine ramifications
of the nerves, and is no other than the immediate principle
of life and sensation. Thus we will establish a
doctrine directly opposite to that commonly received;
for, instead of supposing that the nerves originate from
the brain, we are now led to suppose that they terminate
in it. Instead of supposing that the sensations originate
in the brain, we will be led to suppose that every sensation
originates in the organ appointed for that sensation.
Thus we are conscious that our <i>eyes</i>, not our <i>brain</i>, are
the parts of our body which immediately perceive the
light; our fingers, or any other parts of the body, <i>feel</i>
what is applied to them; and of consequence we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
reason to believe that the <i>animal spirits</i>, <i>nervous fluid</i>, or
whatever we please to call it, proceed from the surface
of the body inwards to the brain, not outwards from the
brain to the surface of the body. The brain itself seems
to resemble a large collection or reservoir of water, in
which the sensations, like so many small streams from
every part of the body, unite, and in which our intellectual
faculties reside in a manner totally inexplicable by
us. Thus far it seemed necessary to theorise, in order
to form some idea, however obscured, of the connexion
between the nerves and our sensitive and intellectual, or,
if we please to call them so, our <i>spiritual</i> faculties.</p>

<p>21. In consequence of this very intimate connexion
between the blood and nerves, it is easy to see that any
injury done to the one may very greatly affect the other;
and that a very slight, nay, to us imperceptible, change
in the organization of either, may produce the most
grievous, and even incurable disorders throughout the
whole body, or in any particular organ. Let us now
consider a little farther the blood-vessels.</p>

<p>22. It hath been a question, whether in the structure
of these vessels nature hath observed an exact proportion.
For instance, if the blood passes by a kind of starts
through four cavities, as we are assured that it does, it
seems natural to suppose that these four should be exactly
equal. This, however, hath been denied; and
some, from its accommodating the human frame to
their theory, have fancied that they saw the use of such
disproportionate work. Dr. Huxham expresses himself
in the following words: “Nor doth the air only refrigerate
the blood, but, by preventing its too great ebullition,
and condensing it, hinders it from bursting the
vessels. This indeed is of exceeding great importance,
if, with the very learned <i>Helvetius</i>, we suppose the capacity
of the right ventricle of the heart to be greater
than that of the left, and that the pulmonary arteries
are larger than the correspondent veins; for it thence
follows, that the blood ought to be considerably condensed
by the inspired air, that an equal quantity of
blood may be received, in one and the same time, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the pulmonary veins and left ventricle of the heart,
that is thrown off from the right ventricle, and
through the more capacious pulmonary arteries. This
indeed many deny, asserting quite the contrary. It is
necessary, however, that the aorta should receive as
much blood from the left ventricle of the heart, as is
thrown off from the right ventricle through the pulmonary
artery; and that in the very same and equal
time, or a fatal deluge would soon overwhelm the
lungs, because the contraction of each ventricle is
made at one and the same time; we always find
therefore the aorta and pulmonary artery, in a natural
state, equal on this account; also the capacity of the
ventricles ought to be equal, that they may receive,
in one and the same space of time, equal quantities of
blood,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>If any thing farther is necessary upon this subject, we
may still observe, that if the blood were at all condensed
by the air, it would be so unequally, because the air is
at some times much colder than at others; and thus the
disproportion of the cavities of the heart to one another
could not fail of producing the most disagreeable if not
fatal effects. We often see what terrible consequences
ensue upon the enlargement of any part of an artery
near the heart; and these would, sometimes at least, be
felt by every individual<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, indeed, that this objection will in some degree
hold, even though we suppose all the cavities of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
heart to be equal, and the capacities of the blood vessels
to be perfectly uniform throughout the whole body.
For, if we suppose the blood to be at all condensed in
the lungs by the coldness of the atmosphere, it must undoubtedly
follow, that while passing from them it occupies
less space than before it arrives at them. Hence
the pulmonary vein, the left auricle of the heart, the left
ventricle, the aorta, and all the rest of the arteries for a
considerable way, must be comparatively empty, even
though they receive as much fluid as fills the vena cava,
right auricle and ventricle of the heart, and pulmonary
artery. The equality which ought to prevail in
the system, and which indeed cannot be dispensed with,
can only take place in those remoter branches of the arteries
in which the blood has reassumed its former state
of dilation or rarefaction.</p>

<p>23. If we consider this matter attentively, we shall
find it not a little mysterious. Every time we breathe
out the air we have sucked into our lungs, a considerable
quantity of moist vapour is breathed out along with it;
but it has been proved by undeniable experiments that
the emission of aqueous vapour from any substance cools
it in proportion to the quantity of vapour emitted.
Every breath we draw, then, cools the lungs, and
consequently the blood, to a certain degree, and, as the
number of times that we breathe in a day is exceedingly
great, the cold produced by the evaporation ought to be
in proportion. But we see that, notwithstanding all this
cooling, whether we breathe cold air or hot air, the
temperature of the body remains still the same. The
air then, though constantly carrying off the heat of the
body, does not cool it in the least by its action on the
lungs. The only possible way of solving this apparent
contradiction is, by supposing that the air, when acting
upon the blood in the lungs, leaves precisely as much
heat as it carries off, and therefore, though we breathe
ever so long, we cannot by this means become either
hotter or colder.</p>

<p>24. To illustrate this subject, we might now enter
into an inquiry concerning the origin and cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
animal heat; but this will be touched upon hereafter.
We shall here only take notice that the heat of the body
is almost universally allowed to proceed from the lungs.
It has likewise been demonstrated, that the air does in
fact contain an incredible quantity of heat, even when it
appears to us to be extremely cold. A certain proportion
of this heat is separated from it every time we
breathe; and if, either by the mixture of other fluids
with the air we breathe, or by any change in the organization
of the body itself, a greater or smaller proportion
of heat should be communicated to the blood, disease
must ensue.</p>

<p>25. To sum up then what has been said concerning
the blood and nerves: The whole mass of fluid passes
from the right side of the heart to the lungs. In the
lungs it receives from the air <span class="nowrap">something<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> necessary to
the functions of life and sensation, and purifies itself from
those matters which might prove pernicious. From
the lungs it passes to the left side of the heart, and
thence through the whole body. In its passage through
the body, it is accompanied with nerves, which, taking
up from the arterial blood that <i>vital spirit</i> received from
the air, convey it to all the organs of motion, of sensation,
and to the brain, where the whole powers of
perception being united form our <i>intellectual faculties</i>,
and, as far as our senses can perceive, the human spirit
itself. The blood, thus deprived of its spirit, is collected
from all parts of the body by the veins, and returned
to the right side of the heart, from whence it is again
sent to the lungs, and the process carried on as before.
This hypothesis concerning the peculiar function of the
nerves I first inserted in the <span class="smcap">Encyclopædia Britannica</span>,
second edition, under the article <span class="smcap">Blood</span>, in the year
1778. It has been since continued in the third Scots
edition, and from thence into the Irish and American
editions.</p>

<p>26. It has already been observed, that the body is
subjected to a continual waste. One source of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
waste is the breath, by which a considerable part passes
off in vapour. A great quantity also passes off by the
pores of the skin; frequently in a perceptible liquid
called <i>sweat</i>, but oftener in an invisible vapour from all
parts of the body, called <i>insensible perspiration</i>. The latter
has been thought to be the great source of waste to
the human body; and it is certain, that if any person in
health be weighed when he rises in the morning, he will
be found considerably lighter than when he went to bed.
The loss of weight in this case proceeds not only from
the pores of the skin, but from the lungs; but though
physicians have made a general allowance for both these,
I have not heard of any experiment by which we can
determine how much passes off by the one, and how
much by the other, nor indeed does it appear easy to
make such an experiment. Galen plainly overlooks the
perspiration from the lungs entirely. “This excrementitious
vapour (says he) is expelled through small orifices,
which the Greeks call pores, dispersed all over
the body, and especially over the skin, partly by sweat,
and partly by insensible perspiration, which escapes
the sight, and is known to few.” Sanctorius, and the
succeeding writers, have classed both together indiscriminately;
allowing the discharge to be so great, that if
eight pounds of aliment be taken in, five of them pass
off in this manner. In a system of anatomy, published
at Edinburgh in 1791, the author says, that the discharge
by the skin “is even much larger than this (the
discharge from the lungs we may suppose) since it
not only throws off a quantity of the aliment, but
likewise what is added to the blood by inhalation,
which, entering often in a very considerable quantity,
is thus again expelled.” The same author likewise
says, that the “perspirable matter from the skin is principally
water,” and that it issues in such quantity as to
be seen in subterraneous caverns evidently flying off
from the surface of the body like a dense vapour. But
other physiologists, particularly Dr. Blumenbach, inform
us, that the matter of insensible perspiration is quite
similar to the discharge from the lungs, particularly containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
a great quantity of fixed air. The same account
is given in Chaptal’s chemistry, on the authority
of Messrs. Milly and Fouquet. This may be looked upon
as a valuable discovery, especially in conjunction with
that related by Drs. Beddoes and Girtanner, viz. that
the flesh of animals contains a quantity of oxygen. Dr.
Girtanner obtained a quantity of this air from the raw
flesh of animals, and says that it may be repeatedly obtained
by exposing the flesh to the atmosphere, and
distilling with a heat of 60 or 70 degrees of Reaumur’s
thermometer (something below that of boiling water.)
Hence it is natural to conclude, that, as the discharge
from the lungs purifies the blood from its useless parts,
so does the insensible discharge from the skin purify the
solid parts from those particles which are no longer useful.
The probability of this also becomes greater by
considering, that in diseases, when the quantity of matter
to be thrown off is very great, the skin becomes foul,
the teeth furred with black sordes, &amp;c. all which disappear
as soon as the quantity of the offensive particles is
reduced to its natural standard. As to any considerable
quantity of aqueous vapour being discharged this way,
unless in case of sweat, it does not seem probable; for
in such a case our clothes would always be moist; and
in the night time the accumulation of moisture would
certainly be perceptible. The sweat is entirely of a different
nature from the insensible perspiration, and blood
and even <i>sand</i> has been known to issue through the skin
along with it. (<i>See the Anatomical System above quoted.</i>)</p>

<p>27. This very considerable waste of the body is repaired
by the aliment taken into the stomach. In the
mouth it is mixed with a considerable quantity of
the liquid called <i>saliva</i>, and in the stomach with another
called the <i>gastric juice</i>, with which that organ always
abounds. From the stomach it passes into the intestines,
where it is mixed with other two fluids; one called
the <i>pancreatic juice</i>, the other the <i>bile</i>. This last is of a
yellow colour, and is sometimes produced in enormous
quantities, insomuch that Dr. Wade, in his account
of the fevers in Bengal, mentions some patients who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
have voided by stool half a gallon of bilious matter
in one day.</p>

<p>28. In the stomach principally the aliment undergoes
a certain change called <i>digestion</i>, by which it becomes
capable of being converted into the substance of the
body. Much has been inquired and disputed, to no
purpose, about the nature of this change, and how it is
effected. One party has declared for <i>attrition</i>; a second
for <i>putrefaction</i>; a third for <i>heat</i>; a fourth have supposed
that our meat was digested by <i>chewing</i>; as if, like the
lobster, people had teeth in their stomach! and, lastly,
some learned moderns, after much pains and trouble,
have found out that it is digested by <i>solution</i>. Dr.
Moore has summed up the discoveries concerning digestion
in the following words: “The food, being previously
divided and blended with the saliva and air by mastication,
(chewing) is swallowed, and meets in the stomach
with the gastric juice, whose dissolving power,
assisted by the natural heat of the place, is the principal
agent in digestion. The process is completed by
the pancreatic juice and bile, the nutritious parts of
the food being by this process converted into chyle
for the support of the body, and the grosser parts
thrown out.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>

<p>29. The inside of the stomach and intestines are full
of the mouths of innumerable small vessels, which continually
suck up from the aliment, as it passes downwards,
the finer parts, in form of a white liquid, called <i>chyle</i>;
and from the whiteness of their colour the vessels have
the name of <i>lacteals</i>, from the Latin word <i>lac</i>, milk.
After passing through the substance of the stomach and
intestines, and running along the membrane called the
<i>mesentery</i>, to which the intestines are attached, the lacteals
unite in a large reservoir called the <i>thoracic duct</i>;
and this again opens into a large vein on the left side,
called the <i>subclavian</i>, which conveys the blood from half
the upper part of the body; soon after terminating in
the vena cava, by which the chyle is conveyed to the
heart, thence to the lungs, and so on in the common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
course of circulation. The conversion of the chyle into
blood is called the process of <i>sanguification</i>.</p>

<p>30. The blood, thus formed out of the aliment we
swallow, is not one uniform fluid like water, but composed
of three distinct substances; one, which gives it
the red colour, and seems to be composed of little round
globules; another, quite colourless, but of a viscid nature,
and which very soon coagulates, called the <i>lymph</i>;
and a third, of a yellowish colour, and retaining its fluidity
much longer, called the <i>serum</i>. A remarkable
property of this last fluid is, that air can act through it
upon the blood; for Dr. Priestly found that a portion
of black blood assumed a bright, florid colour from the
air, even though covered with serum an inch deep.
When blood is drawn, the red globules are detained by
the lymph which coagulates, and both together form
the red mass called <i>crassamentum</i>; the serum remaining
fluid, and retaining its name.</p>

<p>31. Besides these fluids, the blood either invisibly
contains, or is capable of being converted into, a great
many others; for all the fluids in the body are separated
from it, and all of them, the bile only excepted, from
the arterial blood, before it has lost that portion of its
spirit which it imbibes from the air. When a fluid is
to be secreted, sometimes it is done only by an infinity
of small vessels branching off from the arteries, and depositing
the liquids which pass through them in particular
places; and such are the fluids which moisten the
inside of the body, and which are carried off by the
breath, or by sweat. But this separation does not by
any means hinder the artery from terminating in its usual
way in a vein, for in no case is the whole substance of
the blood converted into any other liquid; all of them
appear to be contained in it. But the greatest number
of fluids are separated by means of certain substances
called <i>glands</i>. These are small round or oval shaped
bodies; each of them enclosed in a membrane or skin
which separates it from the other parts, and each furnished
with a small tube called the <i>excretory duct</i>, through
which the liquor separated in the gland passes to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
place of destination. Each gland has also an artery and
nerve, and a vein to bring back the blood after it has
parted with the fluid intended to be separated. The
bile is separated in the liver from the blood of a large
vein called the <i>vena portarum</i>, formed by the union of
some of the veins of the intestines and mesentery. This
vein branches out through the liver like an artery, terminating
in other veins, which at last bring back the blood
to the heart.</p>

<p>32. As the human body is thus furnished with an
apparatus for separating and carrying off, it is also furnished
with one for absorbing or taking in. All the
inward parts of the body are moist; and the moisture is
furnished by the small vessels above described, and
which separate part of the lymph from the blood. By
such continual separation the cavities of the belly,
breast, brain, &amp;c. would soon be filled with liquid, were
not some means provided for carrying it off as fast as it
is formed. The means in question are a set of small
vessels called <i>lymphatics</i>. These “arise from the internal
surface of the breast, belly, and every cavity of the
body; they also overspread the whole external surface
of the body, and large lymphatic vessels are usually
found close to the large blood vessels of the extremities,
besides those small superficial ones which lie
above the muscles in the cellular membrane (the fat
or rather the membrane containing it.) The large
viscera generally have two sets of lymphatics, one
lying on the surface of the viscus, and the other
accompanying the blood vessels belonging to it. The
faculty of absorption, though refused to the lymphatics,
was ascribed by many anatomists to common veins,
and this opinion continued to prevail in some degree,
until Hunter and Monro totally overturned it,
exploding at the same time the notion that any of the
lymphatics are continuations of arteries, and establishing,
beyond a doubt, that all are absorbent vessels.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span>
All the lymphatics terminate in the thoracic duct; so
that the liquid separated by the <i>exhalant arteries</i> (so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
vessels are termed by which that fluid is separated) is
again mixed with the blood, and again performs the
same offices.</p>

<p>We have now taken a review of the several parts of
the human body, slight and superficial indeed, but such
as the limits of this work would allow, and sufficient to
furnish to those entirely unacquainted with medical
matters some general ideas on the subject. We have
seen that the body, in general, consists principally of
four great parts, the blood-vessels, the lymphatic vessels,
the nerves, and the muscles. Besides these we enumerate
the glands and membranes; the former being nearly
allied to the blood-vessels, the latter <i>apparently</i> to the nerves.
The bones, having no concern with our present inquiry, are
not taken notice of. The stomach and intestines, being
principally composed of muscular fibres, nerves, and
blood-vessels, must be considered as belonging to these
departments. Each of these large divisions has obtained
the name of <i>system</i>; and even the subdivision of the
blood-vessels into arteries and veins. Thus the arteries
of the body, taken collectively, are called the <i>arterial system</i>;
the veins the <i>venous system</i>; the brain and nerves the
<i>nervous system</i>; the muscles the <i>muscular system</i>; the lymphatics
the <i>lymphatic system</i>; and the glands the <i>glandular system</i>;
&amp;c. These appellations have been given for the sake of distinctness
and perspicuity, but they have had a bad tendency.
Insignificant disputes have arisen concerning the
superiority of one system to the other, and which is to be
accounted the <i>primum mobile</i> of the body. By observing
also the <i>general</i> structure of the body in a more full and
ample manner than that of the parts which compose it,
physicians have been apt to generalize too much in their
theories, and to fancy that from a few obvious laws they
might be able to explain the phenomena of disease in
almost every possible variety. To illustrate this, let us
take the blood for an example. This to sight appears
an homogeneous fluid; and Boerhaave and others have
ascribed diseases to some defect or bad quality of the
blood. But this fluid consists of three parts, each, as far
as we can perceive, essentially distinct from the other;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
viz. the lymph, serum, and red globules. As each of
these happens to be diseased, the cure must be different;
or if two happen to be diseased, the medicines must still
be varied. But, besides these general diseases arising
from what, like the blood, is common to the whole
body, each component part of the body has an arterial
system, a venous system, a nervous and lymphatic
system, &amp;c. belonging to itself; all of which, though
dependent on the body at large, have yet laws of their
own, in consequence of which any one of them may be
considerably diseased without much affecting the general
system; and this constitutes what is called <i>local</i> disease.
Again: The parts of the body are so connected with
one another, that the disease of one may show itself in
another; or it may affect the whole body in such a
manner as to produce a general disease; though Dr.
Rush considers this last, at least from injuries of the
viscera, as a rare occurrence<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> but we certainly know
that general diseases are very often followed by evident
diseases of particular organs; and in these cases it is impossible
to say whether the general disease did not begin,
though imperceptible to us, in that very organ in which
we suppose it to terminate when the local disease was
come to such an height as to be evident to our senses.
In some cases it is plain that local injuries will bring on
most violent diseases of the whole system. Thus a local
inflammation of the end of one of the fingers, by physicians
called a <i>paronychia</i>, has been known to induce a
most violent fever, nay, even to occasion death. These
violent symptoms end as soon as the suppuration is
completed; so that, were it not for the excessive pain of
the inflammation, we might be apt to suppose that the
fever terminated in the suppuration, whereas it evidently
was occasioned by the local disease, or the tendency
of the part to suppurate; the pain and inflammation
being necessary preliminaries. Again: When
an intermittent fever is said to terminate, or to be followed,
by a hardness of the liver, we do not certainly
know whether an original disease of the liver might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
have been the cause of the intermittent. From a consideration
of all these things, viz. the extreme diversity
of parts which compose the human body, the ultimate
invisibility of the structure of each, the incomprehensible
manner in which they are united, the equally incomprehensible
dependence they have upon one another in some
cases, and independence in others, the numerous laws by
which they are governed, and which must be very much
unknown to us, the invisible and incomprehensible nature
of the powers which act upon them, &amp;c. &amp;c. I say,
when we consider all these things, the boldest theorist
must be humbled when he attempts to account for the
phenomena of disease in any one instance. The excessive
difficulty in which we are involved is beautifully
described by Dr. Ferriar when speaking of hysterics;
and obstacles equally insuperable by our theories will
undoubtedly be met with in any other distemper.
“We are ignorant (says he) by what laws the body possesses
a power of representing the most hazardous disorders,
without incurring danger; of counterfeiting
the greatest derangement in the circulating system,
without materially altering its movements; of producing
madness, conscious of its extravagances; and of
increasing the acuteness of sensation by oppressing the
common sensorium. In hysterical affections all these
appearances are excited, which are incompatible with
the reasonings of every system-maker who has yet endeavoured
to explain the inexplicable. Nature, as if
in ridicule of the attempts to unmask her, has, in this
class of diseases, reconciled contradictions, and realized
improbabilities, with a mysterious versatility, which
inspires the true philosopher with diffidence, and reduces
the systematic to despair.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these difficulties, however, physicians
have theorised, and that with such animosity, as
if all the arcana of nature had been laid open to every
professor who thought proper to invent or new-model a
system; though the constant succession of theories
might certainly have shown them the vanity of such
attempts. Some of these we must now consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>Medical theorists have exerted their greatest abilities
in explaining the nature of those general diseases affecting
the whole body, denominated <i>fevers</i>; and which
are likewise called <i>acute</i> diseases, from the violence with
which they sometimes attack, and the rapidity with
which they run through their course. Dr. Fordyce
says, that fever will sometimes kill in <i>five minutes</i> from
the first sensation of uneasiness. Ancient physicians
have described a number of fevers, which they supposed
to be of different species, and accordingly have distinguished
by different names. Modern system-makers
have added to the number; so that a bare detail of
the names which they have given to their divisions and
subdivisions, would constitute a very formidable catalogue;
but the latest practitioners are decidedly of
opinion that there is but one kind of fever, varying itself
according to circumstances. Dr. Rush declares
himself of this opinion in the most express and positive
terms. “There is (says he) but one fever. However
different the predisposing, remote or exciting causes
may be,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still, I repeat, there can be but one
fever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thus fire is an unit, whether it be produced
by friction, percussion, electricity, fermentation,
or by a piece of wood or coal in a state of inflammation.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span></p>

<p>“I have said that there is but one fever. Of course
I do not admit of its artificial division into genera
and species; a disease which so frequently changes
its form and place, should never have been designated,
like plants and animals, by unchangeable characters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Much mischief has been done by nosological
arrangements of diseases. They erect imaginary
boundaries between things which are of an homogeneous
nature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They gratify indolence in a
physician, by fixing his attention upon the name of a
disease, and thereby leading him to neglect the varying
state of the system, &amp;c.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span></p>

<p>So much then having been said and written upon the
disease in question, one might be apt to suppose that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
nature of fever would have been thoroughly investigated,
and its causes explained in the most satisfactory manner,
long before this time. Instead of this, however, we find
it still like a word which every body uses, and nobody
understands. Dr. Fordyce, who has lately written a
treatise on the subject, endeavours to prove that there
is not any single symptom from the existence of which
we can certainly determine the presence of this disease.
“Fever (says he) has obtained its name in Greek, Latin,
Arabic and Persian, principally from the idea of heat:
<i>pur</i>, in Greek fire; <i>febris</i> in Latin, from <i>fervere</i>, to
burn,” &amp;c. This idea, he goes on to demonstrate, is
erroneous; as the body of a feverish patient frequently
sinks the thermometer below the natural standard; while
the patient sometimes finds himself cold when the thermometer
shows him to be really hot, and hot while the
same instrument shows him to be cold. Neither is cold,
followed by heat, a certain indication of the presence of
fever, as many fevers begin without any previous sensation
of cold. Frequency of the pulse also is no certain
sign; and having discussed this last symptom he concludes
thus. “If we examine the restlessness, anxiety,
state of the tongue, head-ach, or any other of the
symptoms which often take place in fever, we shall
find that they also may be present when there is no
fever, and absent in a patient afflicted with this disease;
and therefore we cannot allow that there is any pathognomic
symptom of fever.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> Dr. Rush declines giving
any definition of fever<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> but, with all due deference to
these two very experienced physicians, we must account
such extreme scepticism altogether erroneous. If fever
cannot be defined, it cannot be described; for a <i>definition</i>
is no other than a short <i>description</i>. If again there
be no single symptom by which the presence of fever can
be known, it is impossible that there can be any <i>combination</i>
by which it can be known, any more than we
can form an unit by any combination of cyphers. In
fact Dr. Fordyce himself is at last obliged to acknowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
that there is a certain symptom with which fever <i>generally</i>
begins; and, by his insisting upon it in various parts of
the work, we must certainly be induced to suppose that
it was by this sign principally that he determined whether
his patients had a fever or not. “The first appearance
(says he) which generally takes place is uneasiness
and restlessness; a general uneasiness, the patient feeling
himself ill, but incapable of fixing on any particular
part of the body. This uneasiness affects the mind
at the same time. Perhaps in this case it is the mind
that is first affected.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Along with this uneasiness
there is a restlessness, the patient wishing to change
his place or posture frequently; the mind cannot likewise
rest upon one object; it often wanders from one
to another subject. At the same time there is a feel
of weariness which resists the disposition in the patient
to change his place and posture, and resists the disposition
of the mind to alter the object of its attention,
rendering the wish for such changes ineffectual.
With these arises an actual inability of exerting the
muscular powers, or performing any of the functions
of the body; and also an actual inability of exercising
the great faculties of the mind, the powers of perception,
memory, arrangement of ideas, and of the judgment,
in the same degree that they existed in health.
The degree in which these take place is extremely
different in the attacks of different fevers; but these
appearances are <i>very rarely</i> absent, although indeed
they may also happen in other diseases.”</p>

<p>Dr. Rush accounts the lassitude with which fever
begins, one of the transient phenomena of it; and this
with other phenomena he calls <i>symptoms</i>. Such as are
more permanent and fixed, and which by other writers
have been reckoned different species, he calls <i>states</i>;
and of these he enumerates forty. Such as have any
relation to the plague are as follow.</p>

<p>I. The <span class="lowercase smcap">MALIGNANT</span> state, known by attacking frequently
without a chilly fit, is attended with coma, a
depressed, slow or intermitting pulse, and sometimes by
a natural temperature or coldness of the skin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
This depressed state of fever more frequently when left
to itself terminates in petechiæ, buboes, carbuncles,
abscesses and mortifications, according as the serum,
lymph, or red blood, is effused in the viscera or external
parts of the body.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="lowercase smcap">SYNOCHA</span>, or common inflammatory state;
attacking suddenly with chills, succeeded by a quick,
frequent and tense pulse, great heat, thirst, and pains in
the bones, joints, breast or sides.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="lowercase smcap">BILIOUS</span> state of fever; known by a full, quick
and tense pulse, or by a quick, full and round pulse
without tension, and by a discharge of green, dark coloured
or black bile from the stomach and bowels.
This state sometimes assumes the form of an hectic;
the patient feels no pain in his head, has a tolerable appetite,
and is even able to sit up and do business.</p>

<p>4. The <span class="lowercase smcap">TYPHUS</span> state; known by a weak and frequent
pulse, a disposition to sleep, a torpor of the alimentary
canal, tremors of the hands, a dry tongue, and, in some
instances, a diarrhœa. Sometimes it assumes symptoms
of synocha on the eleventh, fourteenth, and even twentieth
days. The common name of this state is the
<i>nervous</i> fever.</p>

<p>5. Intermissions, or the <span class="lowercase smcap">INTERMITTING</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">REMITTING</span>
states, occur most distinctly and universally in
those which partake of the bilious diathesis.</p>

<p>6. The <span class="lowercase smcap">SWEATING</span> state occurs not only in the
plague, but in the yellow fever, small pox, pleurisy,
rheumatism, hectic and intermitting states.</p>

<p>7. The <span class="lowercase smcap">FAINTING</span> state; occurring in the plague, yellow
fever, small pox, and some states of pleurisy.</p>

<p>8. The <span class="lowercase smcap">BURNING</span> state. This is attended not only
with an intolerable sensation of heat in the bowels, but
with a burning sensation excited in those who touch the
patient’s skin. It occurs mostly in the remitting fevers
of Asia.</p>

<p>9. The <span class="lowercase smcap">CHILLY</span> state differs from a common chilly
fit by continuing four or five days, and to such a degree
that the patient frequently cannot bear his arms out of
bed. The coldness is most obstinate in the hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
feet. A coolness only of the skin attends in some cases,
which is frequently mistaken for an absence of fever.</p>

<p>10. The <span class="lowercase smcap">INTESTINAL</span> state; including the cholera
morbus, diarrhœa, and cholic.</p>

<p>11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The <span class="lowercase smcap">APOPLECTIC</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">PHRENETIC</span>,
<span class="lowercase smcap">PARALYTIC</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">LETHARGIC</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">VERTIGINOUS</span> states.</p>

<p>16. The <span class="lowercase smcap">ERUPTIVE</span> state; including the small pox,
measles, and other exanthemata of Dr. Cullen.</p>

<p>17. The <span class="lowercase smcap">HÆMORRHAGIC</span> state; known by fluxes of
blood from various parts of the body.</p>

<p>18. The <span class="lowercase smcap">CONVULSIVE</span> or <span class="lowercase smcap">SPASMODIC</span> state. Convulsions
are frequently attendant on the malignant state
of fever.</p>

<p>19. The <span class="lowercase smcap">CUTANEOUS</span> state; attended with various
eruptions on the skin, particularly <i>petechiæ</i>.</p>

<p>These include the most remarkable varieties described
by physicians as different species. From the subsequent
account of the symptoms of the plague, it will appear
that this single distemper monopolises, as it were, the
symptoms, at least the most dangerous and terrible, belonging
to them all. Those nosologists therefore who
suppose the states of fever above described to be different
species, instead of saying that the plague belongs to one
kind of fever, ought to say that it is a complication of a
great many different kinds. But here a question arises:
Do all the varieties of fever just now described, or do all
the other fevers described by different authors, include
all the different modes by which the plague makes its
attack? If so, then we know that the plague really
partakes of the nature of fever, or may be accounted
the highest degree of it. This is the opinion of Dr.
Rush; for in his 4th vol. p.&nbsp;153, he considers the
different inflammatory states of fever, according to their
strength, in the following order. 1. The plague. 2.
The yellow fever. 3. The natural small pox. 4. The
malignant sore throat, &amp;c. To this I can have but
one objection, and to me it appears insuperable; viz.
that the plague frequently destroys without any symptom
of fever; and, if so, we must certainly account
it a distemper of another kind. To decide this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
matter, let us compare the symptoms of the most violent
fever with what happens in times of violent pestilence.
We can scarce imagine a fever more powerful
than that which destroys in five minutes, and the following
is the description of it from Dr. Fordyce. “When
the first attack of fever has been fatal, it has been
classed among sudden deaths, and all of these have
been very erroneously called apoplexy, or syncopy
(<i>fainting</i>.).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the attack is fatal, it sometimes
kills in five minutes, sometimes it requires half an
hour, seldom longer than that time. While the patient
is yet sensible, violent head-ach with a great sense
of a chilliness takes place, the extremities become very
cold, and perfectly insensible; there is great prostration
of strength, so that the patient is incapable of supporting
himself in an erect posture; he becomes pale, his
skin is of a dirty brown, and he is soon insensible to
external objects; the eyes are half-open, and the cornea
somewhat contracted. If the patient goes off very
soon, the pulse is diminished, and at last lost, without
any frequency taking place, but if it be longer before
he dies, the pulse becomes excessively small and frequent;
all the appearances of life gradually subside,
and the patient is carried off. Of this the author has
seen instances, sometimes at the first attack, oftener in
the returns of the disease, although very few.”</p>

<p>This no doubt is very terrible, and no plague whatever
can exceed it. Indeed, when <i>death</i> is the termination,
it signifies little what the <i>disease</i> is called. But the
question is not whether fever or plague is the most dreadful,
but whether they are the same. Now, from the
above description, it is plain that fever never kills without
some warning. In the present instance, head-ach
and chilliness give a certain, though short, warning of
the ensuing catastrophe; but, in violent plagues, Dr.
Sydenham informs us, that people have been suddenly
destroyed as if by lightning. Dr. Guthrie assures us
that in the last plague at Moscow he has seen soldiers
drop down suddenly as if they had been struck by lightning,
or by a musket ball; yet some of these recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
by bleeding and proper management; but it is certainly
not unreasonable to suppose that many, who were not
thus taken care of, perished. Dr. Hodges speaks of the
contagion of the plague in the most energetic terms. He
says, “it is so rare, subtile, volatile and fine, that it insinuates
into, and resides in, the very pores and interstices
of the aerial particles. It is said to be of a
poisonous nature also, from its similitude to the nature
of a poison, so that they seem to differ in degree only;
for the deadly quality of a pestilence vastly exceeds
either the arsenical minerals, the most poisonous animals
or insects, or the killing vegetables; nay, the
pestilence seems to be a composition of all the other
poisons together, as well as in its fatal efficacies to excel
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The contagion of the plague is
more active than lightning, and in the twinkling of an
eye carries to a distance putrefaction, mortification
and death. As for the manner whereby it kills, its
approaches are generally so secret, that persons seized
with it seem to be fallen into an ambuscade or a
snare, of which there seems to be no suspicion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In the plague of 1665, as in many others, people frequently
died without any symptoms of horror, thirst,
or concomitant fever. A woman, who was the only
one left alive of a family, and in her own opinion in perfect
health, perceived upon her breast the pestilential
spots, which she looked upon to be the fatal <i>tokens</i>;
and in a very short space died, without feeling any
other disorder, or forerunner of death.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A youth
of a good constitution, after he had found himself suddenly
marked with the tokens, believed at first that
they were not the genuine marks, because he found
himself so well; yet he was dead in less than four
hours, as his physician had prognosticated. A fever,
however, did for the most part show itself, and was
always of the worst kind. Sometimes it seemed to resemble
a quoridian, sometimes a tertian; there never
was a total cessation, but every exacerbation was worse
than before.” In like manner the author of the
Journal of the Plague Year informs us that many, supposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
themselves, and supposed by others, to be in good
health, would suddenly find themselves seized with great
sickness, crawl to a bench, and instantly expire. “Many
(says Dr. Hodges) in the middle of their employ,
with their friends and other engagements, would suddenly
fall into profound, and often deadly sleeps.”</p>

<p>It is needless to multiply examples: the above are
sufficient to show that the plague, when in its most violent
state, kills suddenly and imperceptibly, and that
like the bite of a vampire<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> without producing any sensible
disorder. In a state somewhat inferior, it excites
the most malignant fevers; in one still inferior it produces
fevers of a milder nature, and so on until we find
it so mild, that those infected with it are not even confined
to their bed. In all this inquiry, however, we find
the secrecy and invisibility of the pestilence, so often
mentioned in scripture, still confirmed. Other distempers
may “waste openly at noon-day,” but this always
“walks in darkness.”</p>

<p>In one of the inferior stages of this distemper the body
is affected with those eruptions named buboes and carbuncles.
Dr. Patrick Russel, in his treatise on the
plague at Aleppo, divides the symptoms of the distemper
into six classes. In the first there were no eruptions,
and all the patients of this class died. In the second,
and all the rest, there were buboes and carbuncles. But,
in the latter of these especially, it is worthy of remark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
that they appear neither as a suppuration, nor as a common
mortification, but like the eschar formed by a caustic,
which can scarcely be cut by a knife. This appearance
is not to be met with in any other disease. In
many there are mortifications of various parts of the
body, but all these are soft, and seemingly corruptions
of the flesh. When a person dies of any ordinary distemper,
the flesh soon corrupts and dissolves, but there
is no example of its turning to a hard eschar like that
made by a hot iron, or the caustic with which issues are
made. This shews not merely a cessation of life, but
the operation of some very active power in the body,
like fire, tending to destroy the texture of it entirely, and
to reduce it to a cinder. This power seems also to
operate internally in the fleshy parts; for when the
bodies of those were opened who died with the <i>tokens</i>,
as they are called by Dr. Hodges, upon them, the mortification
was always found much larger inwardly than
it appeared to be on the outside. The tokens themselves
are by Dr. Hodges called “minute distinct <i>biasts</i>,
which had their origin from within, and rose up in
little pyramidal protuberances, sometimes as small as
pins’ heads, at others as large as a silver penny; having
the pestilential poison chiefly collected at their
bases,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>That the plague was by the ancients reckoned a
disease of a nature different from all others, appears from
Galen, as quoted by Deusingius. “What is called the
<i>pestilence</i> is most properly remarked by Galen not to
be a <i>genus</i> of any known disease. For whatever diseases
and symptoms are associated with the plague,
truly and properly so called, the same are wont to be
called <i>pestilential</i> diseases; of which indeed there are
an innumerable multitude, and these not always nor
every where the same.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span></p>

<p>In like manner Diemerbroeck, as quoted by Allen,
gives his opinion, that “The plague is something different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
from a fever, and a fever is only a symptom of
it, as I have <i>very often</i> observed; and therefore some
very ill define the plague by a fever, since a fever does
not essentially belong to it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A pestilential fever,
the <i>companion of the plague</i>, is not occasioned by a
pestilential venom, but by the mediation of putrefaction;
that is, it is not produced because the humours
are infected with the pestilent venom, but because
the heart, being irritated, overwhelmed and
much weakened by the pestilent venom, can neither
duly digest and rarefy, nor govern and sufficiently discharge
the infected humours; which for this reason
putrefy and acquire a preternatural heat, and so excite
a fever; which by reason of the foresaid secondary
cause, is different and distinct from the plague, and a
symptom of it. This is confirmed both by the maxims
and authority of the ancients and moderns, as
well as by practice, and evident examples.”</p>

<p>Thus it appears, both by fair reasoning by induction
from facts, and from the authority of the greatest physicians,
that the plague is certainly a disease by itself,
and entirely distinct from all others. Hence it follows,
that, though we could investigate the causes of fever in
their utmost extent, we might still be ignorant of the
true plague. That nothing, however, may be omitted,
let us now consider what physicians have advanced on
this subject, and what progress they have made in ascertaining
the sources from whence so many direful calamities
are derived.</p>

<p>In an inquiry of this kind, or indeed concerning any
cause whatever, it is plain that the nature of the effect
must be first understood. Fever then being an <i>effect</i>,
we must begin with investigating its <i>nature</i>. But fever
itself is only manifest by certain changes in the human
body. Before we can investigate the nature of fever,
therefore, we must investigate the human body, and
that in a manner very different from what we did before.
We must now consider the sources of life; in what
manner the vital principle acts upon the body, and by
what means its motions can be disturbed, or how they
may be rectified when once disordered, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>The systems of medicine before the time of Boerhaave
are now so generally exploded, that it is needless to take
any notice of them; and the reputation of Boerhaave
himself in this way seems to be almost expiring. His
doctrines, nevertheless, merit some attention, because he
takes into account a principle overlooked by succeeding
theorists, viz. the <i>cohesion</i> of the parts of the body. That
he did so is evident, from his having written upon the
diseases of a <i>weak and lax</i> fibre, and the diseases of a
<i>strong and rigid</i> fibre. In other respects he followed in a
great measure the mechanical physicians of the former
century. He therefore took but little notice of the
nervous system, as being less subject, or indeed to appearance
not at all subject, to the known laws of mechanics.
The blood was more manageable. The
microscopical discoveries of Lewenhoeck furnished an
excellent foundation for his system. This celebrated
observer had discovered, or fancied he had discovered,
that the red part of the blood is composed of globules.
Inaccurate indeed these globules must have been, since
each of them was composed of six; four touching one
another in the middle, with one above, and one below,
thus <span class="figinline"><img src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="" /></span>. The serum was said to be composed of single
globules, and by this attenuation it was supposed that the
fluid, instead of red, appeared of a <i>yellow</i> colour. Still,
however, this was insufficient. Each of the yellow globules
was <i>discovered</i> (either by fancied observations or
by conjecture, it matters not which) to be composed of
six others, which, singly taken, might constitute the
lymph or some other fluid; and thus, like the number
of the Beast, we might go on by sixes to the end of the
chapter, and solve all the phenomena of nature. In
justice to the microscopists, however, it must be observed,
that some of them have given a much less fanciful
account of the structure of the blood than Lewenhoeck.
Mr. Hewson found it composed of vesicles, or small
bladder-like substances, with a black spot in the middle.
These vesicles dissolved in pure water, but kept their
original form, which he says was as flat as a shilling,
when a small portion of neutral salt was added to the
fluid. The solid particles he supposed to be produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
by the lymphatic system; the black particles by the
spleen.</p>

<p>The supposed observations of Lewenhoeck were of
considerable use to Boerhaave in the forming of his
system of medicine, though they seem not to have
accorded very well with his doctrine of lentor or viscidity
in the blood. But, let this be as it will, having laid it
down as the foundation of his theory, that the diseases
of the body proceeded from too great a laxity of the
fibres, or from too great a rigidity of them, and a great
many from this <i>lentor</i>, his practice was accordingly directed
to such medicines as he imagined would remove
these supposed causes of disease. As the lentor of the
blood was one of his favourite suppositions, he was therefore
perpetually at war with this imaginary enemy, and
dealt very much in saponaceous medicines with a view
to break it down. But here it is evident that this great
man was mistaken, even though we should allow the
existence of lentor as much as he pleased. The viscidity,
<i>lentor</i>, or any other state of the blood, is an <i>effect</i> of
something. It is part of that state into which the body
is brought by the disease. The efforts of the physician
therefore ought to be against that which produces the
lentor; for, unless this be done, the cause of the disease
must perpetually counteract the medicines by producing
new lentor as fast as they destroy it; and besides, must
have greatly the advantage of the physician, by being
already in possession of the whole mass of blood, while
the medicines can only enter it very gradually, and that
by the stomach and lacteals, instead of being instantly
mixed with it, and exerting their power immediately
upon the fluid itself.</p>

<p>But besides this mistake, which is common to other
systems, Boerhaave’s lentor has been denied, and that
upon such strong grounds that it is now universally exploded.
Another system quickly succeeded, in which
every thing was managed by the nerves. This was
introduced by Hoffman, adopted, and perhaps improved,
by Dr. Cullen, under whose auspices it acquired such
a degree of celebrity, that for a long time it was dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
to write or speak against it; and the person who had
the audacity to do so underwent a kind of medical
proscription from the Edinburgh College and all its
students. According to this celebrated theorist, the
brain is that part of the body first formed in the
embryo; it may be seen with nerves proceeding; from it
long before the heart or any blood-vessel belonging to it
is visible. Hence we are to conclude that this part
is necessary to the existence of every other part of the
body, though it doth not appear that they are essentially
necessary to its existence. The superiority of the nerves
to all other parts being thus established, the Doctor
undertook to prove that all other parts of the body
were formed from them; that the body is nourished
immediately from them, and in short that the whole
body is in such subjection to the nervous system, that,
except for the mere purpose of distending the vessels, we
can scarcely know for what end the blood exists;
since the nerves can alter its consistence, or that of any
of the fluids secreted from it, by a mere affection of that
system, without any thing either added to or taken from
the vital fluid.</p>

<p>Thus we were compelled to believe that all diseases
at their first origin are affections of the nervous system,
from whence they are propagated through the whole
body. The Cullenian practice in acute diseases, of which
the plague is the most violent, was built upon a maxim
of Hoffman: “Atonia gigoit spasmos:” <i>Atony produces
spasms</i>. In explaining the nature of typhus fever, therefore,
with which he classes the plague, the Doctor supposed
that the contagion acted first upon the nervous
system, by producing therein a debility. The immediate
effect of this debility is a <i>spasm</i>, or preternatural contraction
of the capillary vessels, or extremely small arteries.
Hence the blood finds some difficulty in circulating,
and the patient is seized with shivering, and has
a sense of cold. When this has continued for some
time the system begins to <i>re-act</i> against its enemy; the
spasm is resolved, and, the reaction of the system continuing,
the action of the heart and arteries is augmented,
and the body becomes warmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>Thus the coldness, shivering, and consequent heat,
which constitute the first attack of fever, are very plausibly
explained; but in the mode of cure this learned
physician fell into the same mistake with Dr. Boerhaave;
for though spasm is undoubtedly, even according to himself,
an <i>effect</i>, he directs his medicines entirely against it,
as if it were a <i>cause</i>. Thus, forgetting what he had just
before advanced, that the spasm is occasioned by debility,
he recommended the most debilitating medicines
and regimen to cure people already too much debilitated;
and to such practice his enemies alledged that
many fell victims. The theory and practice, however,
still kept its ground; and as great numbers of students
were every year bred up in the belief of it at Edinburgh
College, who carried the principles of their teacher to all
parts of the world, it bade fair for becoming universal.
But, in the midst of this eclat, the whole system received
such a rude shock from the doctrines of <i>John Brown</i>,
though at that time not even M.&nbsp;D. as it hath not yet
recovered.</p>

<p>Though the author of the new system contended, as
much as Dr. Cullen, for the supremacy of the nerves, he
did not upon that foundation attempt to establish his
practice. He considered the living body as one machine,
the <i>whole</i> of which might be acted upon, and always was
acted upon by certain powers. It possesses a certain inexplicable
property called <i>excitability</i>, capable of being
augmented or diminished. Every power which augments
the <i>excitability</i> he called a <i>stimulus</i>; the opposite
would have been a <i>sedative</i>; but according to this
system there is not any sedative, nor can there be one in
nature. The reason is, that excitability itself has no
existence but in consequence of the action of certain
powers called <i>stimulants</i>. The total subduction of these
reduces the excitability to nothing; of consequence no
power can act against it in a state of non-existence.
What other physicians call <i>sedatives</i>, therefore, according
to the new system, are only weak <i>stimulants</i>. The
fallacy of such reasoning is obvious; but as it does not
affect the practice, we shall not spend any time in considering
it further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>On the principles just now laid down, the Brunonian
system divides all diseases to which the human body is
liable into two great classes; the one produced by too
much excitement, the other by too little. The former
contains those diseases by other physicians called inflammatory;
the latter such as are called nervous, putrid,
or all in which the powers of life are too weak, and require
to be supported. This last is supposed to be much
more numerous than the former; and in the cure of
these it was that the founder of the system appeared to
greatest advantage. A most violent altercation took
place between Dr. Brown and the Edinburgh College;
yet, notwithstanding all the influence of the professors, and
their unanimous opposition to the new doctrines, they
found themselves ultimately unable to resist a single man
unsupported either by wealth or reputation. The plausibility
of his system, and its being obvious to every capacity,
overcame every obstacle; so that even the practice
of the Cullenians themselves underwent considerable
alterations. It is not, however, to be denied that the
system hath been considerably improved, or at least altered,
by some of Dr. Brown’s pupils, who have had the
advantage of extensive practice, and of visiting many different
countries; which the Doctor himself never had. His
materia medica was besides exceedingly confined; the
only medicines he had any great opinion of, being laudanum
and ardent spirits. The Peruvian bark he held in very
little estimation, as being a weak stimulus. He seems
to have been unacquainted with the virtues of mercury,
except in the venereal disease, and most probably would
have given laudanum in those cases of fever where mercury
is found by others to be so efficacious. But this
deficiency hath been abundantly supplied by some of
his followers. In a work entitled “The Science of
Life,” published by Dr. Yates and Mr. McLean, practitioners
in the East Indies, we find mercury exhibited
in prodigious doses. As a specimen we shall
select their third case, which was a dysentery. On the
first of September the patient took two grains of calomel
and as much opium every two hours. This was continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
for two days. On the third, the dose was
given every hour; besides which, he had half an
ounce of mercurial ointment with a drachm of calomel
rubbed into his body. Next day the pills were
continued, and the quantity of ointment tripled by
thrice rubbing in. This was continued for three days,
at which time, an eruption on the skin appearing, it was
feared he could not be salivated; this eruption being a
sign that no salivation could be produced. The same
mode of treatment, however, was persisted in. September
7th the calomel in the pills was augmented to
four grains; the warm bath was used, and the ointment
continued; but at night twenty grains of calomel and
six of opium were given every two hours. At the same time
two ounces of ointment, with four of calomel, were ordered
to be rubbed in. Next day, though his pulse
was almost imperceptible, and his extremities cold,
“the medicines were continued as far as circumstances
would admit;” with what view it is not said, nor
indeed is it easy to be discovered. At one in the
morning, however, the patient died; an event not at all
surprising. Our authors excuse themselves for this
failure by saying that the viscera of the patient were
diseased, as was evinced by the impossibility of exciting
a salivation; and “that when a patient is evidently incurable
by the common practice, it becomes the duty
of the practitioner to depart from it.”</p>

<p>No doubt we may readily assent to both these assertions;
but though a patient be evidently incurable by
the common practice, or by any other, there is no
necessity for killing him, or for persevering in a course
of violent medicines that evidently make him worse.
The whole of this case indeed strongly militates against
the doctrine of excitement; for if mercury be such a
powerful stimulus to the powers of life in general, how
comes it to pass that in the present case the unhappy
patient, instead of being in the smallest degree excited,
was prodigiously debilitated, and that from the very
first time of taking the medicines. This will appear
from the following table, exhibiting the symptoms of the
disease as they kept pace with the medicines taken.</p>

<p>From a consideration of this patient’s symptoms, in
comparison with the quantity of mercury taken, it most
evidently appears, that it acted in no other way than as
an irritating poison; affecting, with extreme violence,
the already diseased intestines, and, instead of exciting
the vital powers of the whole system, manifestly destroying
them. Let it not be imagined, however, that this
case is selected from the rest merely because it was fatal,
or because it affords an opportunity of finding fault with
the practice recommended in the book. It is the only
one in which the mercury had a fair trial; and even
here it was not very fair, as being conjoined with a great
quantity of opium. In the other cases, which terminated
favourably, the mercury was overpowered by such
horrible doses of opium, that we cannot tell which medicine
had the greatest share in the cure; besides, that
in other cases the patients were allowed the free use of
wine, which we all know to be a powerful stimulant and
cordial; but it is not said that the poor man, whose case
is above related, had a single drop of wine, or any thing
else, except opium, to support him against the action of
such a violent medicine.</p>

<p>On this case it is of importance still to remark, that it
affords, in the strongest manner, an argument against
what our authors say, p.&nbsp;86, that “mercury acts by
supporting the excitement of the whole body, it invigorates
each particular part; and thus occasions, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
a certain extent, the regeneration of those organs
which may have been injured by disease.” In the instance
adduced, there is no evidence of a stimulus upon
any other part of the system than the bowels, which
were already debilitated or diseased in such a manner
that they could not bear it. The system in general,
instead of being excited, was sunk and debilitated from
the very first moment, until at last the excitement terminated
entirely by the patient’s death. But further:
There is very little probability that mercury or any other
medicine whatever can prove a general stimulus, and
that for the following reasons.</p>

<p>1. No medicine can assimilate with the substance of
the body. Medicines properly so called are here alluded
to. Food or drink of any kind taken for the support of
the body while in health, however they may act medicinally
upon occasions, are excepted.</p>

<p>2. The body is composed of many various substances,
each differing in its nature from the other. The
nature of the medicine, whatever it may be, is uniform,
and cannot act upon substances of different kinds in an
uniform manner; and without this there can neither be
an universal stimulant, nor an universal debilitant.</p>

<p>3. All medicines, being incapable of assimilation with
the body, must be considered, when taken into it, as foreign
matter; and the introduction of them at any rate
is in fact the creating of a disease. This is evident from
multitudes of instances where people by quacking with
themselves, and taking medicines unnecessarily, have
destroyed their health.</p>

<p>4. As every medicine has one peculiar nature, and
one mode of action in consequence of that nature, it
must, when introduced into the body, where there are
fluids of various natures, act upon one of them more
than the rest; and this may be called the <i>chemical</i> action
of that medicine upon the body.</p>

<p>5. In consequence of the chemical action of the medicine,
the mode by which it is expelled out of the body
will be different; for, as all medicines are extraneous
substances, they must be sent out of the body as fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
as possible; and it is their action upon one particular
part which promotes their expulsion. Thus, if from
the nature of the medicine it acts in a certain way upon
the stomach and bowels, it will vomit or purge, or perhaps
both; and by this action it is expelled from the
body, along with whatever other matters happen to be
in the stomach or intestines; and thus medicines do
good only accidentally; for mere vomiting or purging
are most certainly diseases; but where noxious
matters exist in the bowels, and do not naturally excite
these operations, an emetic or purgative is unquestionably
useful. Here the authors of the Science of Life
reason differently; and it is worth while to refute their
argument, as being the foundation of such <i>tremendous</i>
practice as nobody of common sense would choose to be
the subject of. Of tartar emetic they speak in the
following terms. “That tartar emetic is a stimulant of
very high power, is evident from the small quantity of
it which produces the state of indirect debility that
occasions vomiting. It should be given in such a
manner as to increase and to support the excitement.
But this will be found difficult, as the duration of
its action seems to be even shorter than that of opium.
If its action does not continue more than a quarter
of an hour, might it not be repeated at such short
intervals, and the doses so reduced as to allow the
establishment of the indirect debility?” This is
arguing in a circle. They first suppose that vomiting is
occasioned by indirect debility, that is, the weakness
produced by an excessive stimulus to the whole system,
as in cases of drunkenness; and then, from the existence
of vomiting, they prove that a general stimulus had
pre-existed. The cases, however, are widely different.
In cases of drunkenness, the person feels himself at first
exhilarated, alert and active, which shows the existence
of a general stimulus. But who has ever found himself
exhilarated by taking a dose of tartar emetic? Yet in a
general excitement it is absolutely necessary that this
exhilaration should take place, because it is an inseparable
consequence of an addition of vital power, let it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
come in what way it will. Thus we know that if a
person happens to be much exhausted by fatigue and
abstinence, he will be exhilarated and his strength augmented
by a single mouthful of meat, as well as by a
glass of wine. This shows that both these are general
stimulants to the system; but what medicine have we
that will produce similar effects? Perhaps opium
comes the nearest in the whole materia medica; but
the uneasiness it occasions in the stomach manifests a
greater action upon it than the other parts; for if the
whole body were equally excited, the withdrawing of the
stimulus, or its naturally losing its force, could only
have the same effect with fasting or fatigue; but the
debility of the stomach, the confusion of the head, and
other effects which attend a dose of opium, demonstrate
that it acts partially, and not equally over the whole
body. The Science of Life indeed says that these effects
are owing to the improper omission of the medicine, or
not repeating the doses in due time. This may be;
but no improper exhibition of food, or want of due repetition,
will produce such symptoms; which undoubtedly
is a proof that food stimulates the system in one
way, and opium in another.</p>

<p>6. If any medicine could be found that acted as an
universal stimulus or exciter of the whole system, it
could not like others be expelled, by any particular evacuation;
but, by destroying the balance between the
force of the acting powers and the subject on which they
act, would most certainly kill, unless very powerful
means were used to counteract its effect. The only
stimulant we are acquainted with which acts equally on
the whole system, and which can be readily exhibited as
a medicine, is that pure kind of air called by Dr.
Priestley <i>dephlogisticated</i>, by Scheele <i>empyrean</i>, and by the
French chemists and their followers <i>oxygen</i>. The exciting
powers of this air, when breathed instead of the
ordinary atmosphere, are astonishing. It not only augments
the appetite, but the power of the muscles, and the
inclination to use them; so that without any intoxication
or delirium the person cannot refrain from action; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
it not only exhilarates the spirits in an extraordinary
manner, but beautifies the face. Did the cure of diseases
therefore, or any set of them, depend on mere excitation,
no other medicine but <i>oxygen</i> would be necessary.
What effects it may have in diseases of debility is
not yet ascertained; but to persons in health it certainly
proves fatal: their bodies are unable to bear its powerful
action, and of consequence they waste, and would die of
consumptions, if its effects were not counteracted. Nor
is this at all an easy matter; for Dr. Beddoes informs us
that, by breathing this air for a short time each day, only
for three weeks, he found himself in great danger of a
consumption, and was obliged to use much butter and
fat meat in his diet, besides giving up the use of the air
altogether, in order to get clear of its mischievous
effects.</p>

<p>Another mode of stimulating or exciting the whole
system is, by putting into it a larger quantity of blood
than it naturally contains. This is entirely similar to
the breathing of <i>oxygen</i>; especially if arterial blood be
used, which has already imbibed its spiritous part from
the atmosphere. In the last century the transfusion of
blood was proposed not only as a mode of curing diseases,
but of restoring old people to youth; and Dr.
McKenzie, in his Treatise on Health, quotes from the
memoirs of the Academy of Sciences several instances of
the blood of brute animals being infused into human
veins, without any inconvenience. It seems, however,
not only a bold but an unnatural attempt to use the
blood of beasts for such a purpose; and, however lavish
mankind may be of their blood upon certain occasions,
it is to be feared that there are few who would be willing
to spare any to relieve another from sickness; but indeed
little can be said about the practice; as, on account of
some bad consequences, or failures, it was forbidden by
the king of France, and by the pope’s mandate in Italy,
and has now fallen into disuse. In a paragraph at the
end of Heister’s surgery (4to edition) it is asserted that
the transfusion of blood was productive of madness.
Dr. Darwin, however, in his Zoonomia, still proposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the transfusion of blood as a remedy, and even describes
a convenient apparatus for performing the operation.
In one part of his work he says, “Might not the
transfusion of blood, suppose of four ounces daily, from
a strong man, or other healthful animal, as a sheep or an
ass, be used in the early state of nervous or putrid
fevers?” In another place he mentions his having proposed
it to a gentleman whose throat was entirely closed
up by an incurable swelling, so that he could swallow nothing.
This is a disease not very rare, and which always
must be fatal; because the patients, though not affected
by any sickness, die of hunger; and, to relieve them
from this miserable situation, extraordinary attempts are
not only allowable but laudable. The Doctor proposed
to his patient, “to supply him daily with a few
ounces of blood taken from an ass, or from the <i>human
animal</i>, who is <i>still more patient and tractable</i>, in
the following manner: To fix a silver pipe, about an
inch long, to each extremity of a chicken’s gut, the
part between the two silver ends to be measured by
filling it with warm water; to put one end into the
person hired for that purpose, so as to receive the
blood returning from the extremity; and when the
gut was quite full, and the blood running through the
other silver end, to introduce that end into the vein
of the patient, upwards towards the heart, so as to
admit no air along with the blood. And, lastly,
to support the gut and silver ends on a water plate
filled with water of 98 degrees of heat; and, to measure
how many ounces of blood were taken away, to
compress the gut from the receiving pipe to the delivering
pipe.” The gentleman desired a day to consider
of this proposal, and then another; after which he
totally refused it, saying that he was now too old to
have much enjoyment of life, and that, being so far advanced
in a journey which he must certainly accomplish
sooner or later, he thought it better to proceed than return.
The Doctor informs us that he died a few days
afterwards, seemingly very easy, and careless about the
matter. One experiment of this kind I have been witness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
to; not indeed on a human creature, but on a calf. This
creature received into one of its jugular veins a considerable
quantity of blood from the carotid artery of another,
nearly of the same age (about a month, or little more.)
It was impossible to say any thing about how much was
transfused; only the bleeding was continued till the
animal which lost the blood began to shew signs of faintness.
The artery was then tied up, and the orifice in
the jugular vein closed. The calf which had lost the
blood appeared very languid and faint, but lived a few
days in a drooping state; when it either died of itself, or
was killed, as being supposed past recovery. The other,
which had received the blood, appeared to be in every
respect highly excited. It became playful, even in the
room where the operation was performed, its eyes assumed
a bright and shining appearance, and its appetite
was greatly increased. Thus it continued for about a
fortnight; appearing all the time to be in high health, and
eating much more than usual; but at last died suddenly
in the night. From these effects on healthy subjects, however,
we cannot infer what would happen in such as are
diseased; but it is plain that if the cure of diseases were to
depend upon mere <i>excitation</i>, the means are in our power,
without any local irritation, which always must take
place in some degree by the use of ordinary medicines.
This path is not absolutely untrodden: the pneumatic
practitioners of the present day have tried oxygen in
consumptions, and found it pernicious; and Dr.
McKenzie informs us that the transfusion of blood was
tried ineffectually in the same.</p>

<p>7. As all the medicines usually prescribed at present
are only to be accounted partially stimulant, or as acting
upon particular parts of the system, we see that some
may promote one evacuation, and some another; while
all produce some change in the organization, which may
prove useful or detrimental, may increase the disease or
cure it, or may produce another, according to the judicious
or injudicious application. But for a knowledge
of all this we must be indebted to experience: there is
not a theory on earth that can lead us a single step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>Before we dismiss the consideration of medical theories,
however, it will still be necessary to give some account
of the new system as it hath branched out in various
ways: for though the fundamental principle is now
received by a great number of physicians, yet the superstructure
is exceedingly different from what Dr. Brown
himself erected and, indeed, from the very same principles
we find conclusions made as directly opposite to
one another as can be expressed in words. Drs. Yates
and McLean, for instance, at Calcutta in the East Indies,
have concluded that the plague “is a disease of a very
high degree of exhaustion;” which Dr. Brown would
have called debility. Dr. Rush at Philadelphia, proceeding
also upon the Brunonian principles, determines
it to be the most inflammatory of all diseases<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> and
which Dr. Brown would have called a disease of excitement.
These two doctrines are, in every sense of the
word, as distant from one another as east from west.
Let us then consider both, if any consideration can avail
us on the subject.</p>

<p>By the ancients it was supposed that diseases were
occasioned by something either bred in the body or received
into it, and that the power of nature produced,
during the course of the disease, a certain change in this
matter, called <i>coction</i>, or <i>concoction</i>; which, if we please,
we may express by the English word <i>cooking</i>. The
matter of the disease, called also <i>morbific</i> matter, thus
<i>cooked</i>, was in a state proper for expulsion, and was
therefore thrown out by sweat, vomit, stool, &amp;c. or it
might be expelled artificially, which could not have been
attempted with safety before. Modern systems deny
the existence of morbific matter, and resolve all into an
affection of the nerves, according to Dr. Cullen by certain
sedative causes, but according to Dr. Brown by
an accumulation in some cases, and an exhaustion in
others, of the excitability or excitement of the body.
The Science of Life commences with stating what they
suppose to be an improvement of the Brunonian principles,
and from which the following account of the origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of diseases is extracted. “Upon the different states of
<i>excitability</i> depend all the phenomena of health and disease.
There are three states of the excitability. 1. The
state of accumulation; when a portion of the usual
stimuli is withheld.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When a portion of the
usual stimuli is withheld, the excitability accumulates,
and the body becomes susceptible of impression in the
direct ratio of the subduction. This state constitutes
diseases of accumulation, or of direct debility. 2. The
middle state; when the excitability is such that the application
of the accustomed degree of exciting powers
produces <i>tone</i> or <i>health</i>. 3. The state of exhaustion.
When the application of stimuli has been greater than
that which produces healthy action, the excitability is
exhausted, and the body becomes less susceptible of
impression in the direct ratio of the excess. This state
constitutes diseases of exhaustion, or of indirect debility.
The states of accumulation and exhaustion of the excitability,
in their different degrees, constitute all the
diseases to which living bodies are subject.”</p>

<p>Here the chime runs on the word <i>excitability</i>, which
is not defined. If we call this property <i>life</i>, then we are
only informed, that, as life is more or less vigorous,
the body enjoys a greater or smaller degree of health;
which we know without any medical instructor. If, instead
of the accumulation and exhaustion of excitability,
we take the original doctrine of excitement and debility
laid down by Dr. Brown himself, we are nothing better.
The whole theory is lost for want of the definition of a
single word. As long as <i>excitability</i> remains an unknown
property, we can explain nothing by it. We may indeed
vary our terms. We may call it <i>nervous influence</i>
with Dr. Cullen, or <i>sensorial power</i> with Dr. Darwin;
but we shall still be as much in the dark as ever; and
all that can be made out of our theories, when our language
is <i>decyphered</i>, must be, that sometimes people are
well, and sometimes they are sick!</p>

<p>Dr. Rush, in his Treatise on the Proximate Cause of
Fever, adopts in part Dr. Brown’s system pretty nearly
as the author himself laid it down. “Fevers of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
kinds (says he) are preceded by general debility. This
debility is of two kinds, viz. direct and indirect. The
former depends upon an abstraction of usual and
natural stimuli; the latter upon an increase of natural,
or upon the action of preternatural, stimuli upon the
body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Debility is always succeeded by increased
excitability, or a greater aptitude to be acted upon by
stimuli.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The diminution or abstraction of one
stimulus is always followed by the increased action of
others.” Here it is evident we are as much in want
of definitions as ever. We know neither what <i>excitability</i>
is, nor what <i>debility</i> is, and yet they are both held out
as the <i>causes</i>, and <i>proximate</i> or <i>immediate</i> causes, too, of
symptoms produced by things quite obvious to our
senses. Thus cold and heat, with which we are daily
conversant, are only called the <i>predisposing</i> causes of fever;
while <i>debility</i> and <i>excitement</i>, words to which we have
no meaning, are said to be the <i>proximate</i> cause. It
would certainly be better to throw away such words altogether,
and say that cold, heat, &amp;c. cause fevers, without
troubling ourselves farther about the matter.</p>

<p>It remains now to take into consideration the pneumatic
theories, founded upon the discoveries made by
Dr. Black, Dr. Priestley, Lavoisier, and others, concerning
various kinds of aerial fluids, or <i>gases</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> as they are
also called. Some of these, particularly that afterwards
called fixed air, were discovered by Van Helmont.
Considerable advances were made by a German chemist,
named <i>Mayow</i>, in the last century; but his book had
fallen into such oblivion that his name was scarce ever
mentioned, until his discoveries were repeated, and still
greater advances made by others. Dr. Hales obtained
air from a great many different substances, but was unable
to ascertain any thing concerning its nature. Dr.
Black of Edinburgh laid the foundation of pneumatic
chemistry, by discovering that a certain species of air is
capable of being absorbed by earths of different kinds,
and that many very heavy substances owe at least one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
half of their weight to this condensed air. The discovery
was accidental. Wishing to obtain a very pure
and white lime, he had recourse to the fine white earth
called <i>magnesia alba</i>. Some of this he distilled with a
heat sufficient to make the vessel red hot. Only a very
small quantity of water came over, but the magnesia had
lost almost two thirds of its weight. This immense loss
was found to arise from an emission of air during the
operation; and by other experiments it was likewise
found that the air might be transferred from one portion
of magnesia to another from which it had been previously
expelled; that the existence of this species of air
in certain bodies was the cause of that fermentation
which takes place when any acid is poured upon them,
as vinegar upon chalk or potash. Hence if any of these
substances be deprived of its air, it will not any longer
ferment in this manner. It must not be forgot, however,
that when air thus unites itself with any terrestrial
substance it no longer has its former properties. It is
reduced exceedingly in bulk, and in proportion to this reduction
only the body is increased in weight; and therefore
though we say that the <i>air</i> is absorbed, we must still remember
that only <i>one part</i> of it is so, and that by far
the least considerable in bulk. A violent fire will always
expel the air again, and restore it to its former bulk;
and again the condensation or absorption of the air is
always attended with the production of heat. This last
property was not much attended to by Dr. Black, but
others have observed it; and the late Dr. Charles Webster
of Edinburgh published a theory in which he maintained
that condensation was in <i>all</i> cases the cause of
of heat. But, however true it may be that condensation
of any kind is followed or accompanied by heat, it is
evidently necessary to know the cause of the <i>condensation</i>
also, otherwise we make no advance in solid theory.</p>

<p>The aerial fluid, discovered by Dr. Black, was one
of those most commonly met with. He called it <i>fixed
air</i>, from its property of adhering or fixing itself to different
bodies. It was found to be the same with that
which had been discovered by Van Helmont, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
him named <i>gas sylvestre</i> (spirit of wood<span class="nowrap">)<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> or the fume
of charcoal; it was found to be the same with the steam
of fermenting liquor, and with that very frequent and
dangerous vapour, met with in coal mines, called in
Scotland the <i>choke-damp</i>. Like other discoveries, this
was quickly pushed beyond its proper bounds, and applied
to the solution of phenomena which it could not
solve. Dr. MBride, particularly, supposed it to be the
bond of union between the particles of matter, or in
other words the principle of cohesion itself. It was also
supposed to be the substance of those scorching winds,
called <i>samiel</i>, met with in Asia and Africa, and which
sometimes prove fatal to travellers. The pernicious vapours
called <i>mofetes</i>, which sometimes issue from the old
lavas of Vesuvius in Italy, were likewise supposed to be
the same<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> but of this, particularly with regard to the
samiel, there seems to be no sufficient evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>The industry of other experimenters did not long
leave theorists without abundance of materials upon
which they might exercise their talents. It is impossible
in this place to assign to each his proper rank in the
way of discovery, or indeed to mention their names.
Dr. Priestley has distinguished himself far above the rest.
He not only repeated and improved Dr. Black’s experiments
on <i>fixed air</i>, but likewise found out a number of
other kinds; particularly that from animal substances in
a state of putrefaction, which is so pernicious to living
creatures, insects excepted; for these last will thrive
amazingly in air that would prove certain death to a
man. He also discovered that this kind of air, and
some others, were absorbed by vegetables, and thence
inferred the use of vegetables in purifying the atmosphere.
He even analysed the atmosphere itself, and found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
it consisted of two different kinds of fluids, one of which
he called <i>dephlogisticated</i>, the other <i>phlogisticated</i> air.
The former was found to support animal life for a time,
the latter to destroy it instantly. Their effects upon
fire were the same; the former exciting the most
vehement heat and bright flame, the latter extinguishing
a fire at once.</p>

<p>The fame of Dr. Priestley’s discoveries quickly reached
the continent of Europe; the French chemists repeated
his experiments with improvements, as they thought;
and indeed certainly made many curious discoveries.
Lavoisier was particularly remarkable for his numerous
and accurate experiments; but, by his changing entirely
the language of former chemists, and substituting a set
of new terms of his own invention, he certainly entailed
the greatest curse upon the science it ever met with.
It belongs not to this treatise to give an account of his
system farther than to say, that, from the immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
proportion of condensed aerial matter found in most
terrestrial substances, he and his followers were led to
conclude, that different species of air constitute almost
the <i>whole</i> of the terraqueous globe. Water particularly
they have absolutely and most positively determined to
be a composition of two airs condensed, viz. the dephlogisticated
and inflammable, which they call <i>oxygen</i> and
<i>hydrogen</i>. However, this doctrine is still opposed by
Dr. Priestley and some others.</p>

<p>In the midst of so much theory, and so many new
and surprising discoveries, it would have been wonderful
indeed if the science of medicine had kept free from
innovation. It did not: the new chemistry, with all
its formidable apparatus of hard words, was introduced,
and thus the study of the science, already very difficult,
was rendered still more so. In passing this censure upon
the modern <i>nomenclature</i>, as it is called, I am sensible
that I must rank with the minority; nevertheless, I have
the satisfaction of finding that I am not altogether singular.
Dr. Ferriar, in the preface to his second volume,
complains, “that, with every attempt towards the formation
of a system, new applications of words are introduced,
which, though desirable in the art of poetry,
are very inconvenient in pathological books, especially
when this is done to give an air of novelty to
old theories and observations. For, between the ancient
language, which practitioners cannot entirely
reject, and the new dialect, which they cannot wholly
adopt, the style of medical books is reduced to a kind
of jargon, that the author himself may possibly understand,
but which his readers find it very difficult to
unriddle. Hence results a neglect of medical literature,
and hence the pernicious habit of regarding as
new whatever has not appeared in the publications of
the last half century.” To the same or a similar purpose,
in the preface to his first volume, he cites Quintilian<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span>
“Some have such a multitude of vain words,
that, while they are afraid of speaking like other people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
by a kind of affected elegance, they confound every
thing they have to say with their immense loquacity.”</p>

<p>The pneumatic system naturally arose from a consideration
of the composition of the atmosphere we
breathe. Finding this fluid to be composed of two
others, the one of which would preserve life for some
time at least, and the other instantly destroy it, it became
natural to think that diseases might be produced
by any considerable variation in the proportion of these
ingredients. An instrument was soon invented by
which any considerable variation in this respect might
be discovered; but upon trial this was found to be of
very little use. Dr. Priestley himself tried, by means of
this instrument, some very offensive air which had been
brought from a manufactory, and could find no remarkable
difference between it and that which was accounted
pure. Still, however, it was evident that by increasing
very much the proportion of one of the ingredients,
some considerable alteration might be produced,
which could not but be perceptible in the human body;
and this led to the application of aerial chemistry to disorders
of the lungs. The mixture chosen for this purpose
was pure dephlogisticated (<i>oxygen</i>) with inflammable
air (<i>hydrogen</i>;) and, though this has not been
known to effect a radical cure, it certainly has given
relief in many cases. In fevers also the application of
fixed air (carbonic acid) hath been found advantageous;
but with regard to oxygen and some others we have not
yet a decided instance of their good effects in any case.
Dr. Beddoes indeed is of opinion that it would be of
service in the sea-scurvy; but in this (whether his conjecture
be right or wrong) the theory is certainly erroneous,
as shall presently be evinced.</p>

<p>In considering the pneumatic system it is evident that
modern chemists have fallen into the same error with
their predecessors, viz. of supposing that every thing
which by the force of fire or otherwise they could
produce, from any substance, previously existed in it.
Hence, as from a piece of bone for instance, a chemist
can produce water, salt, oil and earth, it was supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
that these four were the principles or elements of the
bone. But this was false reasoning; for if these were
really the chemical principles, they ought to have been
able to produce some kind of bony substance by mixing
them together after they had been distilled. But no
such thing could be done; and though we should add
to the mixture the whole quantity of air emitted during
the distillation, and which escaped the notice of ancient
chemists, our success would be no better. In like
manner, because in certain circumstances oxygen is
obtained from the flesh of animals, it has been concluded
that it necessarily exists as an ingredient in their
bodies while living; and that, if this kind of air happens
to predominate, the animal will be affected in one way,
or if hydrogen prevail, in another. But though we have
already quoted Dr. Girtanner with approbation as
having obtained oxygen gas from fresh meat, yet this
does not by any means prove to us that it exists in flesh
as one of its component parts. Even in the Doctor’s
experiment it was necessary to expose the flesh to the
atmosphere in order to procure the gas by distillation;
which undoubtedly must excite a strong suspicion that
the air in question comes from the atmosphere itself; and,
if this is the case, it is not reasonable to suppose that a
disease could be cured by any addition of oxygen to the
solid parts; because, though sound flesh may have an
inclination to absorb this kind of air, we do not know
whether it would have such a property of absorption in a
diseased state. Indeed in the scurvy, which Dr. Beddoes
chooses as an example, experiment seems to determine
in favour of <i>fixed air</i> rather than any other. But let us
hear Dr. Girtanner himself, who has at large discussed
this subject in two memoirs; one upon the laws of
irritability, and another on the principle of irritatibility.</p>

<p>In these memoirs we find the Brunonian doctrine set
forth with such silence in regard to Dr. Brown himself,
that some have not scrupled to charge Dr. Girtanner
with literary <i>theft</i>; but this is a matter which belongs
not to us to consider: the theory may be very good,
whether stolen or not. He changes the word <i>excitability</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
used by Dr. Brown, for <i>irritability</i>; but hath the
misfortune of not being able to tell us what he means
by it. He goes on, however, to distinguish the three
states of <i>tone</i> or health, <i>accumulation</i>, and <i>exhaustion</i>, as
other Brunonians do. Health, he says, in a fibre “consists
in a certain quantity of the irritable principle
necessary for its preservation. To maintain this state,
the action of the stimulus must be strong enough to
carry off from the fibre the surplus of this irritable principle
which the lungs and the circulation of the
fluids are continually supplying. For this a certain
equilibrium is necessary between the stimuli applied
and the irritability of the fibre, in fine that the sum of
all the stimuli acting upon it may be always nearly
equal; powerful enough to carry off from the fibre
the excess of its irritability, and not so strong as to
carry off more than this excess.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the
sum of the stimuli acting upon the fibre is not great
enough to carry off all its excess of irritability, the
irritable principle accumulates in the fibre, and then
it is found in that state which I call the <i>state of accumulation</i>;
the irritable principle accumulates in the
fibre, its irritability is augmented, and the stimuli produce
much stronger contractions than when the fibre
only retains its tone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the sum of the
stimuli acting upon the fibre is too great, the fibre
is deprived not only of the excess of its irritability, but
also of some portion of the irritable principle necessary
for the tone of the fibre; or, more properly speaking,
the fibre loses more irritability than it receives, and,
of course, in a short time finds itself in a state of <i>exhaustion</i>;
and this exhaustion will be either <i>temporary</i>,
or <i>irreparable</i>.”</p>

<p>Here it is evident that we have nothing but Dr.
Brown’s system, without the least explanation to render
it more intelligible. A definition is still wanting. This
invisible and incomprehensible property of <i>irritability</i>
ruins our whole fabric; nor can the deficiency be supplied
by human art or skill: of consequence we must
abandon this part of the system entirely, and come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
something more cognizable by our senses. It is impossible,
however, to pass over in silence the amazing inattention
of the author, in imagining that on such unintelligible
principles he could explain other phenomena.
“In the state of <i>temporary exhaustion</i> (says he) the fibre
loses its tone, and fails for want of irritability. The
application of a stimulus while it is in this state will
not make it contract. Provided the stimulus be not
very strong, it will produce no effect at all, but in a
short time the irritable principle will accumulate afresh
in the fibre, and then it will again contract. It is
only by little and little that the fibre recovers its irritability.
This truth, I dare venture to say, is as new
as it is striking. It unfolds a vast number of phenomena
hitherto inexplicable.” Here we have nothing
but the pompous declaration of a fact already
well known; viz. that not only a <i>fibre</i>, but the whole
body, may be in a state of temporary insensibility, and
yet recover either of itself or by the use of external means.
How many people have fallen into a <i>syncope</i>, and yet recovered!
How many limbs have become paralytic, and
in time recovered their sense and motion! Yet this is
all that we are informed of with so much parade and
assumption of novelty. We know that when a person
is in a faint he is insensible to ordinary stimuli, though
very strong ones will rouse him; but what can we infer
from this? Nothing; only we see it is so. Does it avail
us any thing to be told that during the time of fainting
the <i>irritability</i> is exhausted, and “in a short time the
irritable principle will accumulate afresh;” in which
case the patient will no doubt recover, unless he happens
to be dead, which is the true meaning of an <i>irreparable
exhaustion</i> of the irritability.</p>

<p>In speaking of the principle of irritability he expresses
himself in the following manner. “I think that the
oxygen is absorbed by the blood, and that the venous
blood is oxygenated in the lungs during respiration.
The most celebrated naturalists and chemists are of a
different opinion: they think that the oxygen does
not combine with the venous blood. According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
them, this last loses carbon and hydrogen, and recovers
the bright colour natural to it, without absorbing
any thing from the atmosphere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After having
a long time attended the phenomena of respiration,
and made many experiments upon this subject,
I think it may be concluded that one part of the
oxygen of the vital air combines with the venous
blood, of which it changes the black colour, and
makes it vermilion<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> the second part of the oxygen
unites with the carbon contained in the carbonic-hydrogen
gas, which exhales from the venous blood, and
forms carbonic acid air; a third part unites with the
carbon of the mucus, contained in great quantities in
the lungs, and which is continually decomposing; this
part also forms carbonic acid air; a fourth part of the
oxygen combines with the hydrogen of the blood to
form water.”</p>

<p>On this theory I shall only observe, that though I lay
claim to the former part, I allow the Doctor all the latter
part to himself; particularly where he speaks of the
<i>formation</i> of water to be exhaled during respiration. The
air in question consists of two parts, like <i>fixed air</i> already
mentioned. One of these is capable of being attracted,
condensed, or united with certain substances; the other
vanishes, leaving no other traces of its having ever existed,
but heat, greater or less according to circumstances.
When the air is taken into the blood, one part of
it undoubtedly combines with something thrown out by
the lungs, and forms <i>fixed air</i>, of which our breath contains
a considerable quantity. We know certainly that
the condensable part of fixed air is formed out of the
condensable part of the oxygen, with certain additions.
As therefore great part of this condensable oxygen is
thrown out in fixed air at every expiration, it is natural
to suppose that all of it is so: at least we cannot know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the contrary without a series of very difficult and tedious
experiments, which have never been made by Dr. Girtanner
or any body else. But if the whole of this condensable
part be thrown out, none can enter the blood
by the breath; and consequently whatever true oxygen
may afterwards be expelled from that fluid, must be a
factitious substance, formed either during the artificial
process, used for distilling it, or by a natural process In
the body itself. It is not therefore at all probable that
the oxygen which flesh emits in distillation can be derived
from the air by respiration.</p>

<p>Another and more probable source is the food and
drink we take; all of which are more or less impregnated
with air of different kinds, particularly fixed air.
This, we know, very readily condenses, and certainly
will do so when taken into the body. In this state it
not only may, but certainly will, pass into the blood,
and through all the different parts of the body, until,
having accomplished its purpose, whatever that may be,
it is thrown out by insensible perspiration, as has been
already explained.</p>

<p>The conclusions drawn by Dr. Girtanner from his
experiments are, 1. That the change of colour which
the blood undergoes during the circulation is not owing
to its combination with hydrogen <span class="nowrap">air<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span>. 2. The deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
colour of the blood in the veins is owing to the <i>carbon</i> it
contains. 3. That the vermilion colour of the arterial
blood proceeds from the oxygen with which the blood
is conjoined during its passage through the lungs.
4. That respiration is a process exactly analogous to the
combustion and oxydation of metals; that these phenomena
are the same, and to be explained in the same manner.
5. That, during circulation, the blood loses its oxygen,
and charges itself with <i>carbonic hydrogen</i> air, by means of
a double affinity. 6. That, during the distribution of
the oxygen through the system, the heat which was
united with this oxygen escapes; hence the animal heat.
7. That the great capacity of arterial blood for heat is
owing to the oxygen with which it is united in the
lungs.</p>

<p>On these propositions, which constitute in a great
measure the fundamental principles of the doctrine of
<i>oxygenation</i> of the human body, we may remark,</p>

<p>1. Nobody can reasonably suppose that hydrogen air
is the cause of the dark colour of the blood in the veins,
because there is no source from which it can be derived;
and, besides, it is certain that no kind of air can exist in
its elastic state in the blood, without destroying the life
of the animal. Some experiments proving this are
given by Dr. Girtanner himself. It is true that an aerial
vapour, of the nature of <i>fixed air</i>, exhales from the
body by insensible perspiration; but there can be no
doubt that this receives its elasticity only at the surface
of the body, and is expelled the moment it is formed.
It has indeed been proved, by undeniable experiment,
that no air of any kind exists in the larger veins; because
a portion of a vein, included between two ligatures,
being cut out, and put under the receiver of an air-pump,
does not swell in the least when the air is exhausted,
which yet must be the case, did the smallest
quantity of elastic air exist in it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>
<p>2. When the Doctor asserts that the dark colour of
the venous blood is owing to the carbon it contains, he
is in the first place chargeable with the error of former
chemists, who supposed that every thing which could be
extracted from any substance by fire, existed previously in
it, in that very form in which it is extracted by the fire;
and in the second place he speaks entirely at random,
without even a shadow of proof. Nay, he himself tells
us, that he has repeated two of Dr. Priestley’s experiments,
which in the clearest manner demonstrate, that
neither the addition nor the abstraction of carbon, or
any thing else, give this dark colour to the venous
blood. “A small glass tube (says he) filled with arterial
blood, of a bright vermilion, was sealed hermetically<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span>
and exposed to the light. The blood changed
its colour by degrees, and in six days became
black as venous blood. The same experiment was
repeated, with this difference only, that the tube was
exposed to heat, and not to the light. The blood
became black in a shorter time.” In these experiments
it is plain, that if the blood contained oxygen at
first, it did so at the last; the same with regard to carbon.
How came it then to pass, that without either
evaporation of the former, or addition of the latter, the
change should be produced? If the oxygen imbibed by
the blood in the lungs was sufficient to produce the red
colour, why did it not preserve it? The case here is precisely
similar to what happens with the calx of silver.
When that metal is dissolved in aqua fortis, and again
reduced to a solid form, it appears as a white powder,
and will preserve its colour if carefully kept from the
light; but if a vial be filled with it, and exposed to the
sun, that side on which the light falls will in a short
time become black, and this though the vial has been
ever so carefully sealed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> Formerly, chemists had a method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
of accounting for this appearance, as well as that
of the venous blood, by what they called the <i>evolution
of phlogiston</i>: but now that the very existence of phlogiston
is denied, we are deprived of this resource. But,
whatever words we may use, it is plain that in neither
case have we any ideas affixed to them which can make
the matter at all more intelligible than it was before.
But with regard to the blood, we are at a considerable
loss to understand what the natural colour of it is; and
indeed the question can only be determined by examining
the blood of a fœtus which has never breathed.
If the arterial blood of such a fœtus be of a dark colour,
resembling that in the veins of a grown person, we must
look upon this to be <i>natural</i> to it, and we may as well
inquire why a rose is red, or an iris blue, as why the
blood is of a dark, and not of a bright red. But, if we
find this dark red change to a bright scarlet in the arteries,
as soon as the child has breathed, we have as much
reason to conclude that the air occasions this superior
redness, as that an acid is the cause of a red colour in
the syrup of violets, or an alkali of a green colour in the
same. Experiments are yet wanting to determine this
matter. Mr. Hunter has observed that “in such fœtuses
as convert animal matter into nourishment, they
most probably have it (the colour of the blood) influenced
by the air, such as the chick in the egg, although
not by means of the lungs of the chick, we
find the blood, in the veins of their temporary lungs,
of a florid colour, while it is dark in the arteries.”&mdash;The
probability therefore is, that the blood is naturally
dark; by the elastic principle of the oxygen that it is
rendered brighter; and that, this elastic principle being
expended in the course of circulation, the fluid reassumes
its original colour.</p>

<p>3. Though enough has already been said to evince
that the superior redness of the arterial blood is derived
from oxygen gas, we shall still quote two instances from
Mr. Hunter’s Treatise on the Blood, which set this
forth in the clearest manner; and these instances are the
more remarkable, because they demonstrate the phenomena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
not of the <i>dead</i>, but of the <i>living</i> body. 1. A gentleman
in an apoplexy, who seemed to breathe with
great difficulty, was bled in the temporal artery. The
blood flowed very slowly, and for a long time. It was as
dark as venous blood. He was relieved by the operation;
but, on opening the same orifice in two hours,
the blood flowed of the usual florid colour. 2. A lady
in an apoplexy was treated in the same manner, and Mr.
Hunter observed, that when she breathed freely, the
blood from the temporal artery assumed a bright red
colour; but when her breathing was become difficult,
or when she seemed scarce to breathe at all, it resumed
its dark colour, and this several times during the operation.</p>

<p>4. Respiration is not, as Dr. Girtanner says, a process
similar to the combustion and oxydation (the calcination)
of metals. Some of these by calcination, and
<i>all</i> of them in the opinion of Dr. Girtanner, unite with
the condensable part of the oxygen contained in the air,
while the elastic part is dissipated in flame or heat. The
reverse of this takes place in breathing; for here the
elastic part of the oxygen unites with the blood, and
makes it warm, while the condensable part, uniting with
certain particles to be thrown off from the body, passes
away in fixed air. Thus the process of respiraton does not
resemble the calcination of a metal (at least according
to our author’s opinion of that operation) but rather the
inflammation of some combustible substance; for in
both cases a certain quantity of carbon is found to be
united with the basis of oxygen in the atmosphere, and
thrown off from the place of combustion; and thus a
quantity of fixed air is produced from every burning
substance. Just so is it with respiration. If the condensable
part of the oxygen combined with the blood,
then no fixed air could be produced; or if any part of
the oxygenous base was absorbed, it must certainly be
known by a proportional deficiency in the quantity of
fixed air produced. But there are no experiments made
with accuracy sufficient to determine this point. It is
true that many very able physiologists, as Borelli, Jurin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
&amp;c. have been of opinion, that part of the air is absorbed
in respiration; but when we come to particulars nothing
can be determined. Dr. Hales by experiment
found the quantity absorbed to be a <i>sixty-eighth</i> part of
the whole quantity inspired; but, on account of supposed
errors, he states it only at <i>an hundred and thirty-sixth</i> part.
Between these two the difference is so enormous, that
we know not how to draw any conclusion from them.
The French chemists are more decisive, and agree pretty
well with one another. Chaptal calculates it at <i>three
hundred and fifty-three</i>, and La Metherie at <i>three hundred
and sixty</i>, cubic inches in an hour. Allowing these experiments
to be just, the next question is, what part of
the air is absorbed. Lavoisier says, that it is the oxygenous
base, or the same with that which is absorbed in
the calcination of mercury. But how comes he to know
this? Surely not in the same way that he determines the
absorption of it by mercury. In the latter case he takes
a certain quantity of mercury, includes it in another
known quantity of oxygen air, and heats the metal by
means of a burning-glass or otherwise: the consequence
is, that the air is absorbed, the mercury loses its fluidity,
and is increased in weight. The metal gains the <i>whole</i>
weight of the air absorbed; and, by another process, <i>all</i>
the air and <i>all</i> the metal, or very nearly so, may be obtained
in their original form. This experiment is so
decisive, that nothing can be said against it with any shadow
of reason; but who <i>hath</i> made, or who <i>can</i> make,
similar experiments with the blood of a living man? Such
experiments indeed might be made, if <i>insensible perspiration</i>
did not stand in our way. Common atmospherical
air is about <i>eight hundred</i> times lighter than water. A
cubic inch of distilled water, according to Dr. Kirwan,
weighs <i>two hundred and fifty-three grains and a quarter</i>.
Oxygen air is somewhat lighter than common air: we
shall therefore suppose that six hundred inches of it are
equal to an inch of water. If then the blood absorb
three hundred and sixty inches of air in one hour, it will
in twenty-four hours have absorbed eight thousand six
hundred and forty inches, equal in weight to fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
inches of water and two fifths, which according to
Dr. Kirwan’s estimate is between seven and eight
ounces. But the quantity of matter insensibly perspired
in that time is so much greater, that no calculation can
be made. Here is one mode of determining the quantity
of oxygen inspired totally impracticable in the human
body, though quite easy and practicable in the
case of mercury. The other mode of determining it
by the expulsion of oxygen from the blood is equally
impracticable. Dr. Girtanner indeed has expelled oxygen
from flesh; but we know not in what proportion,
nor can we determine whence it came. With regard to
this last, indeed, there are two sources allowed by Drs.
Beddoes and Girtanner themselves; viz. the absorption
of oxygen by the lungs, and the quantity taken in with
the aliment. A third source was also manifest from Dr.
Girtanner’s experiments; viz. absorption from the atmosphere;
for, by exposure to the atmosphere, flesh,
which had once parted with its oxygen, became again
impregnated with it. In this case therefore we must
acknowledge that the uncertainty of the absorption by
the lungs must be extremely great. A certain quantity
of oxygen is undoubtedly thrown out in fixed air. How
are we to determine this quantity? Certainly not by the
first reverie that happens to occupy our imagination.
It is a problem, the solution of which must be attended
with the utmost difficulty. We must know, in the first
place, how much oxygen was contained in the air <i>inspired</i>.
In the second place we must know the quantity of
fixed air <i>expired</i>. In the third place we must exactly
know the proportion of oxygen contained in the fixed
air thrown out by the breath. In the fourth place we
must determine whether, by the conversion of oxygen
into fixed air, any change is made in its bulk. For, if
this shall be found to be the case, we should be led to
suppose an absorption or augmentation of air when no
such thing took place. This point therefore ought to
be determined with the utmost accuracy. In the fifth
place we must exactly know how much <i>azote</i>, <i>septon</i>,
<i>phlogisticated air</i> is contained in the atmosphere inspired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
and likewise in that expired. In the sixth place, we
must be assured that there are no other fluids in the atmosphere
capable of being absorbed by the lungs, excepting
oxygen and azote. Whether there are any
others or not, hath not been determined. From an
expression of Dr. Fordyce, he would seem to be skeptical
on the subject. “The atmosphere (says he) is found
to consist of various vapours, of which air, or, as it
has been called, pure air, or respirable air, (oxygen air)
forms at present about a fourth. Gas (probably fixed
air) forms some part<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> but the greatest part consists
of one or more vapours, which, <i>without any positive
quality, but from that indolence which makes mankind
in their researches attempt to find a resting place, have
been considered by many chemists as one individual species,
under the names of phlogisticated air</i>,” &amp;c. In the seventh
place we ought to know what quantity of <i>pure oxygen</i>,
unconverted into fixed air, or whether any such, is
thrown out by the breath. That a quantity of this
kind of air is really thrown out, is probable, because we
can blow up a fire with our breath, and by a blow-pipe
excite a most intense heat, capable of melting the most
refractory metals, platina excepted. It is true that the
eolipile, by the mere conversion of water into steam, will
blow up a fire also; though, if the access of external air
be denied, the blast of the eolipile will put the fire out.
Probably the breath would do the same; but even this
cannot be accounted a decisive proof of the oxygen being
totally exhausted; for the moist vapour with which
the breath abounds may extinguish the fire, even though
some small quantity of oxygen should remain in it. It
is not, however, our business at present to enter minutely
into such discussions. From what has been already said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
it is evident, that the absorption of oxygen by the blood,
instead of being indubitably established, is of all things
the most uncertain; the requisites for determining it being
absolutely beyond the investigation of any person,
however accurate. We may indeed, with great labour
and trouble, determine that some part of the air is absorbed
in breathing; but what that part is, we are unable
to discover from any chemical investigation. The
opinion of the simplicity of metals, and their being reduced
to a calx by the adhesion of oxygen, has been
so implicitly, and in a manner universally, received, that
it has given a new turn to physiology, so that, by a kind
of analogical reasoning, the human body has been reduced
to a mere chemical apparatus, the operations of
which may be calculated as we can do the event of experiments
in a laboratory. But, after a very long and
tedious contest, Dr. Priestley seems at last to have overthrown
this doctrine of oxygenation, even in the inanimate
parts of the creation; so that we can much less
apply it to the doctrines of life and animation. His
experiments are published in the third number of
the Medical Repository, volume II, and fully demonstrate,
that, though mercury absorbs oxygen during
calcination, this is not the case with all metals;
that in many cases the oxygen will unite with other
substances in preference to the metal, which last is nevertheless
reduced to a calx as though it had united with
the oxygen; that in many cases the addition of weight
gained by the calx is owing to mere water, &amp;c. He
has likewise shown that phlogisticated air (azote) is not
a simple substance, as has been taught by the new chemists,
but consists, as well as fixed air, of an union of
oxygen with carbon, or at least with the black matter
of burnt bones, with which he made the experiment.
These aerial fluids therefore being so easily convertible
into one another, and the uncertainty of the changes in
bulk which may occur in consequence of these conversions
so great, it is impossible to say whether a portion
of the atmosphere in substance, i. e. both oxygen and
azote, is absorbed, as physicians formerly supposed; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
whether a portion of oxygen air alone be absorbed, as Dr.
Beddoes supposes; or whether only the elastic principle
itself is absorbed, and the diminution in bulk made in
consequence of the conversion of oxygen into fixed air;
I say, these matters depend on circumstances so much
beyond the reach of our senses, that if we come to any
probable conclusion upon the subject, it must be by
analogical reasoning from other known facts, not from
experiments made directly upon the living body; which,
in their own nature, must, always be extremely vague and
uncertain.</p>

<p>5. That, during the circulation, the blood charges
itself with carbonic hydrogen air, is an assertion which
cannot be easily admitted. It has already been observed,
that, by the air-pump, venous blood does not appear to
contain any elastic fluid whatever; and it is also certain,
that animals cannot bear any quantity of air injected
into their veins. Dr. Girtanner himself tried several
kinds, and all of them proved fatal. Having injected a
considerable quantity of oxygen air into the jugular vein of
a dog, the animal raised most terrible outcries, breathed
very quickly, and with the utmost difficulty; by little
and little his limbs became stiff, he fell asleep, and died
in less than three minutes. On injecting into the vein
of another dog a small quantity of phlogisticated air, the
animal died in twenty seconds. With carbonic acid gas
(fixed air) a third dog died in a quarter of an hour. A
fourth was killed in six minutes by nitrous air<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> From
these experiments, had no others ever been made on the
subject, it seems very probable, that no species of air can
be safely admitted into the blood in its elastic state. If
any such therefore should naturally be produced in the
body, it must either be instantly thrown out, or disease
must ensue. Such objections to the Doctor’s theory are
so natural, that we might have thought he would have
foreseen and provided against them. Instead of this he
grounds the whole upon such slender evidence as could
not be admitted in the most trifling matter. “An incision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
(says he) was made in the jugular vein of a sheep,
and the blood which came from it was received into a
bottle filled with nitrous air. When the bottle was
half filled, it was closed. The blood coagulated immediately,
and a separation of a great quantity of blackish
serum took place. The day after, on opening the
bottle, a very strong smell of nitrous ether (dulcified
spirit of nitre) was perceived, the nitrous air having
been changed in part into nitrous ether by the carbonic
hydrogen gas of the blood. This experiment
proves, beyond a doubt, that the venous blood contains
carbonic hydrogen air; and that this air is not very intimately
mixed with it, but may be expelled with the
greatest ease.”</p>

<p>On reading the Doctor’s account of this experiment;
it must be very obvious, that, however decidedly he may
be of opinion that it proves <i>beyond a doubt</i> the existence
of hydrogen air in the venous blood, yet there is not one
solid reason; from what he says, for supposing any such
thing. How can any man determine from the mere
<i>smell</i> of <i>sheep’s</i> blood taken out of the body of the animal,
and mixed with a poisonous vapour, what is the composition
of <i>human</i> blood in the living body? In the case
of any substance suspected to contain elastic air, the air-pump
will always afford an <i>experimentum crucis</i>. But we
know that venous blood does not yield any elastic vapour
by the pump: if instead of blood, however; we should
fill a portion of vein with beer, cyder, or other fermented
liquor, it would instantly discover, by its swelling up,
that it really contained air in an elastic state. If then
from the tumefaction of the vein when filled with fermented
liquor we conclude that the latter contains fixed
air, why should we not, from the non-tumefaction of it
when filled with blood, conclude that the vital fluid
contains no air? If Dr. Girtanner was so well assured
that the venous blood contains hydrogen air, he ought to
have expelled some of it from a portion of the blood,
noted the difference between the blood which had lost
its air, and that which had not, and then, by adding the
air to it again, restored the blood to its former state.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Nothing less then recomposition can prove the truth of a
chemical analysis; as division can only be proved by
multiplication, or multiplication by division.</p>

<p>From all that has been said, we may fairly conclude,
that no proof can be brought sufficient to prove the existence
either of oxygen air or any other species of aerial
fluid, in its elastic state, in the blood. Neither can we
prove that any part of the condensable part of oxygen
air is received by the breath in the lungs. It is, however,
probable that this condensable part may be received
into the stomach with our food; that having passed
through the various channels of circulation, and arrived
at last at the surface, it there resumes its aerial nature by
combining with the superfluous heat of the body, and is
evaporated through the pores of the skin by insensible
perspiration. The aerial vapour which passes off by these
pores indeed has been discovered to partake of the nature
of <i>fixed air</i>; but we know that this species of gas always
contains the basis of oxygen, being indeed composed of it;
and whether the oxygen be taken into the body in its
pure state or not, the result would undoubtedly be the
same; for an union would be formed between it and
the carbonic particles to be thrown off from the body.
But thus we can never suppose the basis of oxygen or
any other air to be a permanent part of the composition
of our bodies; nor can the quantity of it be augmented
by breathing any kind of air. The readiest way to increase
the quantity seems to be by drinking fermented
liquors. Thus, if the body is too hot, the superfluous
heat will have a proper subject to act upon, viz. the condensable
part of the fixed air; and hence we may perhaps
account for the very grateful and cooling sensation
produced by drinking these liquors in some diseases.
With respect to the existence of <i>carbon, charcoal</i> or <i>hydrogen</i>
in the blood, it is probable that it exists in equal
quantity at all times, being indeed the fundamental material
of the whole body, and probably only a modification
of that <i>dust</i> from whence man was originally taken<span class="nowrap">.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span><a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span>
When the blood therefore grows very black, when the
teeth are covered with a black sordes, the hands become
foul, &amp;c. we may say, indeed we too surely <i>feel</i>, that, in
such cases, there is a propensity in the body to return to
its original state of dissolution; but there is not one solid
reason for supposing the proportion of its materials to be
varied; that there is a collection of <i>oxygen</i> in one part,
<i>hydrogen</i> in another, or in short that nature can admit of
any such disproportion taking place.</p>

<p>6. We must now consider Dr. Girtanner’s account
of the origin of animal heat, which is, that, “during
the distribution of the oxygen through the system,
the heat which was united with this oxygen escapes;
hence the animal heat;” and, “that the great <i>capacity</i>
of the arterial blood for heat is owing to the oxygen
with which it is united in the lungs.”&mdash;This leads us
to consider in a more particular manner the doctrine of
heat, a subject hitherto much less investigated than the
importance of the subject requires. What little we do
know of this matter seems to be almost entirely owing to
Dr. Black, who hath discovered some very remarkable
phenomena unknown to former philosophers. His discovery
here, as in that of fixed air, was accidental. Making
experiments on the water of different temperatures,
he found that the mixture would always be an arithmetical
mean betwixt the two quantities mixed. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
on mixing water at 50 degrees with an equal quantity
at 100, the temperature of the mixture would be 75
degrees; but if instead of using water only he took snow
or ice for one of the quantities, the mixture was no longer
an arithmetical mean betwixt the two temperatures,
but greatly below it; so that a quantity of heat seemed
to be totally lost and in a manner annihilated. His attention
was engaged by this unexpected phenomenon, and,
prosecuting his experiments, he found that, when water
was converted into ice, it really became warmer than it
was before; and, by keeping the fluid perfectly still
during the time that cold was applied, he was able to
cool it to 27 degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, which
is five degrees below the freezing point; but on shaking
this water so cooled, it was instantly converted into
ice, and the thermometer rose to 32. On reversing
the experiment he found that mere fluidity in water is
not sufficient to melt ice. A considerable degree of
heat is necessary; and even when this is previously given
to the water, the whole becomes as cold as ice by
the time that the ice is melted. The result of his experiments
in short was this: Water, when frozen, absorbs
an hundred and thirty-five degrees of heat before
its fluidity can be restored: that is, supposing a pound
of ice at the temperature of 32 to be mixed with a
pound of water at the temperature of 32, by adding 135
degrees, so that the temperature of the water is augmented
to 167, the ice will indeed be melted, but the temperature
of the whole quantity of liquid will be reduced
to 32. In this case therefore the heat manifestly assumes
two different modes of action: one in which it acts internally
upon the substance of the body, without being
sensible to the touch, while in its other state it hath no
effect upon the internal parts, but affects bodies on the
outside. The former state therefore the Doctor distinguished
by the name of <i>latent</i>, the latter by that of <i>sensible</i>
heat.</p>

<p>The same theory was applied to explain the doctrine
of evaporation, and that in the most decisive and satisfactory
manner. The Doctor found, that, in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
distillation of water, much more heat was communicated
to that in the worm-tub of the still, than could
be supposed necessary to raise the water distilled to 212
degrees, which is the utmost that water can bear. In
prosecuting the experiment he found the quantity of
heat absorbed by the water, when raised into vapour,
truly surprising; no less than <i>a thousand</i> degrees; an
heat more than sufficient to have made the whole quantity
of fluid that came over red hot. Some objections,
however, were made to this theory, even by the
Doctor’s friends. Mr. Watt, particularly, though he
could not deny the theory derived from Dr. Black’s
experiments, yet suggested one, which, had it proved
successful, would have overthrown the whole. It was
this: Let water be distilled <i>in vacuo</i>, where it boils with
a heat of 97 degrees, and the operation must be carried
on with much less fuel, and with much greater ease, than
in the common mode. It was said that, in this experiment,
Dr. Black was equally concerned with Mr. Watt;
but, in a personal conversation with the Doctor himself,
he assured me that he had no farther concern than foretelling
that the experiment would not succeed, which it
seems did not. The event was as follows: Mr. Watt,
determining at all events to try the experiment, caused
to be made a copper retort and receiver, joined together
in one piece. In the receiver he pierced a small hole,
and, heating both retort and receiver, plunged the latter
into cold water. The consequence was, that a considerable
quantity of water entered the vessel, and was easily
poured back into the retort, as a subject for distillation.
A fire being now applied, the water was soon raised into
steam, which filled both retort and receiver, and in a
great measure expelled the external air. The small orifice
in the receiver being now closed, and the receiver
itself plunged into cold water, the distillation went on
<i>in vacuo</i>; for, as soon as any of the steam was condensed,
the space which it had occupied (according to Dr.
Black <i>one thousand and sixty-six</i> times more than the original
water) was become absolutely empty, and more
steam, rarefied, not by any quantity of sensible heat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
but merely by that which it contained in a <i>latent</i> state,
would occupy the place of the former. The event of
the experiment showed the truth of Dr. Black’s theory.
The water boiled, and steam was raised as well as if
access had been given to the air; but with this difference,
that the upper part of the distilling vessel was never heated
above what the hand could easily bear. With the
water in the cooler it was quite otherwise. It became
hot as usual, and, by the quantity of heat it received,
plainly demonstrated that the vapour, though destitute
of most of its <i>sensible</i> heat, yet contained an immense
quantity in a <i>latent</i> state. The saving of fuel therefore
in the practice of distillation, which was Mr. Watt’s object
in making the experiment, was quite trifling, and
not equal to the trouble of filling the retort with liquid.</p>

<p>The doctrine of latent heat thus established, furnished
a solution of many phenomena which could not formerly
be explained in a satisfactory manner. Thus the
melting of all kinds of substances was found to be owing
to an absorption of heat, while their condensation was attended
with the contrary. Fluidity in all cases was explained
on the same principle; and the more heat that
was absorbed, the more fluid the matter became. Thus
water, when in a condensed or solid state, absorbs 135
degrees of heat before it becomes fluid. A thousand degrees
more convert it into vapour, and at last, by passing
through the intense heat of a glass-house furnace, it
is converted into a brilliant flame, and augments the
heat of the furnace to a great degree. Hence the practice
in glass-houses of throwing water into the ash-hole,
the vapour of which, by passing through the burning
fuel, makes the furnace much hotter than it was. In a
similar manner were explained the phenomena of crystallization,
the ductility of metals, the heat produced by
hammering them, and the hardness produced by the operation,
as well as the operation of annealing, &amp;c. One
other phenomenon, a very curious one, shall be noticed,
on account of its being connected with the subject of this
treatise. It is this: Let a small vessel filled with vitriolic
ether be put into a larger one of water, and both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
included in the receiver of an air-pump. On exhausting
the air, the ether boils, and is converted into vapour,
while the water freezes. This shows that heat
does not always act equally upon surrounding bodies, but
has a tendency to enter some in preference to others;
and from other experiments it appears, that this property
has a considerable connexion with the density of the
bodies concerned.</p>

<p>Thus one step was gained, and it was universally admitted
that heat, in some cases, entered bodies, and in
others was thrown out of them; but now the question
arose, What is heat; and by what laws is it regulated,
or from what source is it derived? Here Dr. Black
himself was at a loss; for, as he supposed <i>cold</i> to be a
mere non-entity, and only to consist in a comparatively
smaller degree of heat, some phenomena occurred which
would not easily admit of solution upon such an hypothesis.
With these Dr. Black did not meddle much,
but others were bolder. Dr. Irving, Professor of Chemistry
at Glasgow, undertook to explain the whole mystery
of latent heat upon the single principle of attraction.
One of the most puzzling phenomena in the way of Dr.
Black’s theory had been, that in some cases heat and cold
seemed to repel each other, and a very remarkable instance
of this was, that, in the morning, a little before
sunrise, when the rays of light pass through the atmosphere,
a little above the surface of the earth, the air then
becomes manifestly colder than even at midnight. Dr.
Irving’s explanation of this was, that the sun’s rays
<i>attracted heat from the atmosphere</i>, and thus rendered it
colder. Such at least was the explanation given in an
inaugural dissertation by Dr. Cleghorn, one of Dr. Irving’s
scholars; for the Doctor himself delivered his
opinions only to them. In other cases he supposed that
different substances had different <i>capacities</i> for receiving
heat; and, of consequence, should the <i>form</i>, or rather
the <i>internal constitution</i>, of the body be changed, the <i>capacity</i>
of it for receiving heat must also be changed; and as
an attraction subsists, or is supposed to subsist, between
heat and all other substances, it is plain that while this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
attraction subsists, if the capacity of any substance for
receiving heat be augmented, it will imbibe much more
than it would have done had its former constitution remained.
Thus <i>water</i> in its liquid state contains a certain
quantity of heat; we may therefore say that water
has a capacity for receiving heat equal to one to ten, or
what we please. Vapour has a capacity for containing
heat ten times greater than water. Water therefore,
when converted into vapour, will imbibe ten times the
quantity of heat that the water contains; and, again, on
being re-converted into water, the <i>capacity</i> becoming
what it was before, the superfluous quantity must be
thrown out, as in Dr. Black’s experiments. In like
manner, when a metal is melted by the fire, the capacity
of it for receiving heat is changed: of consequence a
great quantity is imbibed, and again expelled by the
change of <i>capacity</i> which takes place on its becoming
solid; and thus, from the change of capacity, in different
substances, every phenomenon was solved.</p>

<p>This doctrine of <i>capacities</i> did not give general satisfaction.
Dr. Black himself said of it, that it was neither
<i>probable</i> nor <i>ingenious</i><span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> notwithstanding which, it
continued to be received, and even very generally adopted.
Dr. Crawford, so well known for his writings on
this subject, has adopted the idea, and Dr. Girtanner, in
the passage above quoted from him, appears to be of the
same opinion. The doctrine, however, had several opponents,
among whom were the Monthly Reviewers.
In their account of Nicholson’s First Principles of Chemistry,
they express themselves in the following manner:
“We only wish, that, in the doctrine of heat, he had
avoided, which he might easily have done, Dr. Crawford’s
idea of bodies having different <i>capacities</i> for
heat. In the melting of ice, for instance, a quantity
of heat is absorbed, without any increase of the
temperature, that is, without making the water sensibly
warmer than the ice before its liquefaction; which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
is said to be owing to the water having a greater <i>capacity</i>
for heat, or being able to <i>hold more</i> of it, than
the ice; and, in like manner, when converted into
vapour, its capacity is further increased, or it can hold
more still. This appears to us a very unchemical, and
a very inadequate idea of the matter: for, admitting
water to have a greater capacity than ice, how is the
change from one state to the other to be effected?
Can the properties which a body is found to possess,
after a change has taken place, be assigned as a cause
of the change itself? Or will it be said, that the heat
first enlarges the capacity, and then hides itself in that
capacity so enlarged? We should think it much better
to say, consonantly with the phenomena of other
combinations in chemistry, that a certain quantity of
heat, uniting with the ice, first <i>liquefies</i> it, as a certain
quantity of acid only neutralizes an alkali; that if
any surplus quantity must be introduced, that surplus,
remaining free and uncombined, must act and be sensible
as heat in the one case, and acid other; and that
different bodies require different quantities of heat or
acid to be combined with them, for producing the
changes in question.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Reviewers, as well as others, reasoned <i>a priori</i>,
and several facts were adduced to prove that no such
changes in capacity could take place. But however
strong the arguments adduced, or however plain the experiments
might be, little or no notice was taken of them,
and the enlargement or diminution of <i>capacities</i> has been
repeated, seemingly by rote, from one author to another,
without the least inquiry or investigation. Dr. Girtanner
indeed says that “the oxygen united with the arterial
blood in the lungs” is the cause of the <i>great capacity</i>
of the arterial blood for heat. But this is assigning a
very doubtful cause for a very doubtful effect. He
ought to have proved in the first place that arterial blood
really has this capacity; for its being <i>hotter</i> than the
blood of the veins, only shews that it parts with more
heat to surrounding bodies than venous blood does;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
which is a proof that it contains <i>less</i> heat, if there be any
difference, than that of the veins. But the truth is, that
the <i>capacity</i> for containing heat depends neither on the
oxygenation nor hydrogenation of a fluid, but upon its
density. The more fluid and the more easily expansible
into vapour that any substance is, the greater quantity
of heat it is capable of containing, and <i>vice versa</i>.
This has been fully ascertained by Mr. William Jones,
an English clergyman, whose observations on the generally
received system of philosophy contain many particulars
worthy of attention. From his experiments it appears
that a piece of red-hot iron, thrown into water,
imparts much less <i>sensible</i> heat to it, and is itself much
more effectually quenched, than by throwing it into an
equal quantity of quick-silver of the same temperature
with the water. As the quick-silver therefore becomes
much hotter to the touch than water does upon throwing
a piece of red-hot iron into it, and as the iron itself is
much more imperfectly quenched by the metal than by
the water, it follows that the latter is capable of containing
much more heat than the former. But such experiments
are not applicable to the blood. Though that of the
arteries may be somewhat hotter than the venous blood,
yet the reason is obvious. The heat is communicated
directly to the arterial blood in the lungs; but during
the circulation a part of it evaporates, and the farther
distant any part is from the lungs, the more cool will
the vital fluid be, without regard to any alteration of
<i>capacity</i>, which indeed never can be shown to exist.</p>

<p>But the most decisive experiments against any supposed
alteration in the capacities of bodies for containing
heat are those lately tried by Count Rumford, and
related in the Philosophical Transactions for 1798. His
attention to this subject was engaged by observing the
great degree of heat acquired by a brass gun during the
time of boring it<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> and still more by the intense heat
(much greater than that of boiling water) of the metallic
chips separated from it by the borer. From a consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
of these things he was naturally led to the following
inquiries. “Whence comes the heat actually
produced in this mechanical operation? Is it furnished
by the metallic chips which are separated by the
borer from the solid mass of metal? If this were the
case, then, according to the modern doctrine of caloric,
the <i>capacity for heat</i> of the parts of the metal so reduced
to chips, ought not only to be changed, but the
change undergone by them be sufficiently great to account
for <i>all</i> the heat produced. But no such change
had taken place; for I found, that by taking equal
quantities by weight of these chips, and of thin slips of
the same block of metal, separated by means of a fine
saw, and putting them at the same temperature, that
of boiling water, and putting them into equal quantities
of cold water (that is to say, at <span class="nowrap">59 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> of Fahrenheit)
the portion of water into which the chips were put,
was not, to all appearance, heated either less or more
than the other portion in which the chips were put.”</p>

<p>From this experiment, several times repeated with the
same result, Count Rumford inferred, that the heat
could not possibly have been furnished at the expense of
the latent heat of the metallic chips. He then proceeded
to ascertain “how much heat was actually generated
by friction, when a blunt steel borer being so forcibly
shoved (by means of a strong screw) against the bottom
of the bore of the cylinder, [of the machine in use]
that the pressure against it was equal to the weight of
about ten thousand lb. avoirdupois, the cylinder
being turned round on its axis (by the power of horses)
at the rate of about thirty-two times in a minute.”
In this experiment the metallic dust or scaly matter detached
from the cylinder by the borer weighed only 837
grains troy; but, says the author, “Is it possible that
the very considerable quantity of heat produced in this
experiment (a quantity which actually raised the
temperature of above 113&nbsp;lb. of gun-metal at least 70
degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, and which of
course would have been capable of melting <span class="nowrap">6 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;lbs. of
ice, or making near five pounds of ice-cold water to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
boil) could have been furnished by so inconsiderable a
quantity of metallic dust, and this merely in consequence
of a <i>change</i> of its capacity for heat? As the
weight of this metallic dust (837 grains troy) amounted
to no more than one 948th part of that of the
cylinder, it must have lost no less than 948 degrees of
heat to have been able to raise the temperature of the
cylinder one degree; and consequently it must have
given off more than <i>sixty-six thousand, three hundred and
sixty</i> degrees of heat to have produced the effects which
were actually found to have been produced in this
experiment.”</p>

<p>It was next considered whether the air did not contribute
to the generation of this heat; and our author
determined that this could not be the case; because the
quantity of heat generated was not sensibly diminished
when the free access of air was prevented. From another
experiment it appeared that the generation of the
heat was neither prevented nor retarded by keeping the
apparatus immersed in water. Here the friction generated
so much heat, that in one hour the temperature of
the water surrounding the cylinder was raised from 60 to
107 degrees of Fahrenheit. In half an hour more it was
raised to 142; at the end of two hours to 178; at two
hours 20 minutes to 200; and in two hours and a half
it boiled<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> On the whole, Count Rumford concludes,
that “the quantity of heat, produced equably by the
friction of the blunt borer against the bottom of the
hollow metallic cylinder, was <i>greater</i> than that produced
equably in the combustion of <i>nine wax candles</i>, each
three quarters of an inch diameter, all burning at the
same time with a clear, bright flame.” From all these
experiments, however, our author does not draw any certain
conclusion. “What is heat? (says he.) Is there
any such thing as an <i>igneous fluid</i>? Is there any
thing that can with propriety be called <i>caloric</i>? The
heat produced, in the author’s experiments, by the
friction of two metallic surfaces, was not furnished by
small particles of metal, detached from the larger solid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
on their being rubbed together. It was not supplied
by the air, because the machinery in three experiments
was kept under water, and the access of atmospherical
air completely prevented. It was not furnished by the
water which surrounded the machinery, because this
water was continually receiving heat from the machinery
and could not at the same time be giving to and
receiving heat from the same body; and because
there was no chemical decomposition of any part of
this water.” At last he observes, that the source of
this heat, whatever it is, must evidently be inexhaustible,
adding, that “any thing, which any <i>insulated</i> body,
or system of bodies, can continue to furnish <i>without limitation</i>,
cannot possibly be a <i>material substance</i>; and
it appears to me to be extremely difficult, if not quite
impossible, to form any distinct idea of any thing capable
of being excited and communicated, in the manner
the heat was excited and communicated in these
experiments, except it be <span class="lowercase smcap">MOTION</span>.”</p>

<p>On this last paragraph, however, it is obvious to remark,
that the whole force of the argument rests upon
an <i>insinuation</i>, that the cylinder and borer were <i>insulated</i>,
or cut off from all communication with any other material
substance. Had this been the case, then no doubt
it would follow that an <i>endless</i> supply of any thing <i>material</i>
could not be furnished by them; but if, as Dr.
Boerhaave and many other learned and intelligent persons
have supposed, fire be an element universally present,
and which becomes sensible to the touch only in
consequence of a particular mode of action, it will follow,
that no substance in nature can be <i>insulated</i> with
respect to it; but, in whatever place, and for whatever
length of time, any substance shall be affected in such a
manner as to agitate this fluid, there we shall perceive a
production of heat <i>without limitation</i>, even though heat
itself be no more than the action of a fluid essentially
<i>material</i>, though invisible to us.</p>

<p>Considerations of this kind occurred long ago to the
writer of this treatise, when by the nature of his employment
it was necessary for him to speculate upon these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
subjects. It could not then but appear to him that the
theory of Dr. Black was far superior to any that had
been published. The opinion of those who supposed
fire to consist in the vibratory motion of the particles of
solid bodies, seemed altogether untenable. It is impossible
to explain the phenomena of heat upon ordinary
mechanical principles, because, with respect to all terrestrial
substances, heat constantly appears as an <i>agent</i>,
while they are merely <i>passive</i>; and no man can explain
the nature of a cause from its effect. Thus one of the
most obvious effects of heat is <i>expansion</i>, or enlargement
of bulk, in such bodies as are heated. But if from this
fact we infer that the parts of elementary fire are repulsive
of one another, our reasoning is certainly erroneous.
In like manner, when we are not sensible of heat, we
are not authorised to conclude that it is not present;
for Dr. Black has demonstrated that it may be present
in very great quantity, though indiscoverable either by
our senses or by a thermometer.</p>

<p>But, with regard to the theory published by Dr.
Black himself, it is evident that, though one part of it
rests on the solid basis of experiment, the other is founded
entirely upon hypothesis, and that too an hypothesis
which cannot admit of being proved by any experiment,
viz. that <i>cold</i> is a mere negative, and hath no real
existence in nature. Among many phenomena which
militate against this opinion, the following experiment
of M. Geoffrey seems to be the most remarkable.
He took a small bason filled with water, and set
it on a support in the middle of a large tub of water,
in such a manner that the temperature of the water in
the tub might communicate itself to that in the bason.
This being ascertained by a thermometer placed in the
bason, he threw a quantity of burning coals into the
tub. The effect of this, on the supposition that cold is
a mere privation of heat, ought to have been, that the
heat of the coals, communicated to the water in the
large tub, would in a short time pervade the small bason,
and affect the thermometer there. The latter
would therefore rise; but instead of this it fell several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
degrees before it began to rise; for which it doth not
appear that any other reason can be assigned than that
the cold is partly repelled by the heat of the coals,
and therefore, entering into the small bason of water, it
causes the thermometer to sink previous to its rising.
To the same purpose we may urge the phenomenon
already taken notice of, viz. that the sun’s rays,
when passing at some distance above the surface of the
earth, cool the lower part of the atmosphere. The natural
solution is, that the heat of the sun partly repels
the cold downwards; and as for the doctrine of <i>attracting</i>
heat from the atmosphere, Count Rumford has shown
that this does not happen in a case where we might with
much more probability expect it; not to mention the
violence done to the common perceptions of mankind
by supposing the sun’s rays, which are most evidently
the source of heat, to have any occasion to <i>attract</i> heat
from the atmosphere or any thing else.</p>

<p>Lastly, with regard to the <i>capacities</i> of bodies for containing
heat, the doctrine appears to involve a radical
error, of such enormous magnitude, that it is impossible
to make any thing of it. This is no less than confounding
the heat which flows out from bodies with
that which they contain as an essential part of their
composition, and which they cannot emit without being
changed into some other form. Thus the capacity of
aqueous vapour for containing heat, according to Dr.
Black, is 1000 degrees; yet without decomposing the
vapour it would have been impossible to have known
this; for vapour is often extremely cold to the touch,
and a thermometer immersed in it will sink greatly.
In short, all that we can know about the capacity of
bodies for retaining heat is, that they either continue to
absorb it, or we may continue to force it into them, till
they be reduced to vapour. It is doubtful whether
they can receive more; for from the experiment with
Papin’s digester, formerly mentioned, it appears that the
additional quantity of heat, which the water was made
to receive, very quickly left it as soon as the steam had
room to expand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>But, to come to a conclusion upon this subject: If
we will investigate the nature of heat, we must do it as
in other cases, viz. by making the <i>igneous fluid</i>, <i>caloric</i>,
or what we please to call it, the object of our senses; for
we cannot reason fairly, or indeed come to any rational
conclusion at all, by doing otherwise. In this investigation
it is necessary to attend to the particulars mentioned
by Count Rumford. The fluid must be omnipresent
in its nature, infinite in its quantity, and equable,
uniform and incessant in its action; as far as these
epithets can be applied to any material being. There
are only two fluids which we know that can answer to
these characteristics. The one is the light of the sun,
which pervades all the celestial spaces; the other the
electric fluid, which penetrates every terrestrial substance.
Both of these produce heat, unlimited in quantity, as
well as in duration, provided their action be continually
kept up. The mode in which both produce heat is exactly
the same, viz. by converging into a focus; and
the greater the quantity, the greater is the heat, and that
without any limitation either as to intensity or duration.
With regard to the solar rays, it has long been known
that by concentration they would produce heat; nevertheless
it was unaccountably doubted whether the rays
themselves were the matter of heat. One objection to
this was, that on the tops of high mountains the air is
exceedingly cold, though the sun shines very bright.
But this objection was founded upon an erroneous notion
that, wherever the matter of heat exists, there we must
feel it; which doth not follow any more than that
wherever air exists there we must feel a wind blowing
upon us. <i>Wind</i> is air in motion, and <i>heat</i> is a more
subtile fluid in motion. One demonstration of this is,
that, on the tops of the highest mountains, a burning
lens or mirror will set fire to combustible bodies as readily
as in the vallies at the foot of them. Neither has
heat, properly so called, anything to do with air. The
focus of a burning-glass will heat bodies <i>in vacuo</i> as well
as in the open air; and Sir Isaac Newton has observed,
that if a thermometer be included in the vacuum of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
air-pump, it will acquire the temperature of the room
nearly in the same time that another will when included
in a similar glass without any exhaustion.</p>

<p>The science of electricity is but of late date; and
most violent and hypothetical disputes have taken
place concerning the nature of the fluid. Its luminous
and burning properties naturally led a number of people
to suppose that it was elementary fire; but this was opposed
by others with as much violence as if there had
been something criminal in the supposition. The opposition,
however, was founded upon the same error with
that about the solar light. It was imagined that wherever
elementary fire existed, there heat must be felt; and
it was especially urged, that electricity, though it produced
light, did not produce any heat, except when it
exploded with such violence as to penetrate the internal
substance of bodies, agitating their particles, and by this
agitation producing heat. It has now, however, been
found, that the electric <i>aura</i>, as it is called, when made
to converge in great quantity to the point of a needle,
will heat it to such a degree as to set fire to gun-powder.
This shows that heat is occasioned by the convergence
of this fluid to a focus, and to its divergence from
it. In the focal point, heat will always take place.
From the experiments of Hauksbee, Beccaria and Priestley,
it likewise appears, that electricity will render transparent
the most opaque bodies, such as sealing-wax,
pitch, &amp;c. which even the most intense light of the sun
cannot do. As to the intensity of the heat produced
by it, experiments have shown, that it cannot be exceeded
even by that of the most powerful mirror. Globules
of gold have been vitrified, platina melted, and
the most infusible substances reduced to glass, by means
of the electric shock. From so many evidences, therefore,
it appears to me impossible to conclude otherwise
than that the light of the sun and the electric fluid are
the same thing; and, according to the different modes
in which they act, they produce the phenomena of heat
and light in all their varieties, besides a multitude of
other effects of which we cannot have any perception.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
We may indeed, if we please, suppose that some other
thing exists which is heat itself, and that the light or
electric fluid sets in motion, attracts, repels, or acts
otherwise upon this unknown something; just as it
comes into our heads to fabricate our system. But, until
our senses can discover in some way or other this hidden
substance, <i>reason</i> will always suggest that it has no existence.
We may say that without such a supposition we
cannot solve the phenomena of heat. But do we ever
expect to solve these phenomena; or do we know all
that the solar light and electric fluid can perform? If
we do not know what they <i>can</i> do, neither do we know
what they <i>cannot</i>; and the invention of other fluids
must be accounted not only chimerical but useless.</p>

<p>But, to be more particular: on the subject of heat
people have embarrassed themselves more with philosophical
reveries than by any real difficulty, and rendered
the matter more obscure than nature has made it. We
have already observed, that by the convergence of light,
or of electricity, heat is always produced. Here we can
see the mode in which the fluid acts, viz. first by <i>converging</i>,
and then <i>diverging</i>. When the light falls upon
a solid body, it is evident, that if it be allowed to flow
out as easily as it flows in, no internal agitation of the
parts, or of any fluid contained in them, can take place.
Transparent bodies therefore are never heated. Again,
if the light be not allowed to enter the substance of a
body, but is entirely reflected, the body cannot be heated;
and hence it is very difficult to melt a polished
metal even by a strong burning-glass. M. Macquer’s
burning mirror, which vitrified flints, could not melt
silver. But, when the light falls upon a body capable
of allowing it to enter its substance, at the same time
that it cannot get out without difficulty, it is plain that
the force of the fluid will be exerted in order to overcome
that difficulty; the body will be expanded in all
directions; the fluid will be thrown out in the same
manner, and the more that the internal action of the
light prevails over that power by which the parts of the
body cohere, the more will the phenomena of heat be
perceptible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p>Again, let us suppose that the etherial fluid enters the
substance of any body capable of being dilated to a great
degree, it is equally plain that the action of the fluid
must for some time be directed only upon the internal
parts, and consequently will be imperceptible on the
outside. This then is called <i>latent</i> heat; and where the
pressure on the outside balances that on the inside no
heat will be perceptible to the touch. But by whatever
means this balance is broken, heat will instantly be perceptible;
and experiments show that the balance may
be broken either by an increase of cold or heat. Thus,
in the case of water, the internal pressure remains equal
to the external, until the fluid is cooled to a few degrees
below 32. The balance is then broken, and the internal
action prevails; a quantity of what is called <i>sensible</i>
heat escapes, and the water is converted into ice. Again,
at the temperature of 32, little or none of the water evaporates;
but by the addition of heat, by which the internal
action of the subtile fluid we speak of becomes
greater than the external, the water is converted into
vapour; and it is remarkable that the same effect takes
place on greatly augmenting the degree of cold; for the
evaporation from ice, even in frosty weather, is found to
be very considerable.</p>

<p>On the whole, from innumerable experiments it appears,
that there exists in nature a certain invisible fluid,
by the action of which, when diverging from a centre,
heat is produced in the central point. By a certain other
power this diverging force is limited, so that in some
cases it is not perceptible beyond the surface of the body
in which it acts, and then it is called <i>latent</i> heat. In
other cases it is perceptible in a certain degree, and the
degree in which it is perceptible hath been called the
<i>temperature</i> or <i>sensible heat</i> of the body. On mixing different
substances together it is found, that very often
the proportions between the external and internal actions
are varied. This has been already observed, when giving
an account of Dr. Black’s discovery of <i>latent</i> heat,
viz. that when snow and warm water are mixed together
the temperature of the mixture differs very considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
from the arithmetical mean between the temperatures of
the two substances employed. Dr. Crawford prosecuted
the experiment further, and found that there were few
substances which, on being mixed, did not shew a temperature
different from that of the arithmetical mean between
the temperatures of the two originally employed.
This difference he unfortunately used as the foundation of
a rule for determining the <i>capacities</i> of different substances
for containing heat, and upon this erroneous principle
has raised a superstructure, which upon no occasion
can be of service to science, but must always produce
obscurity and confusion wherever it is introduced.</p>

<p>With regard to the power which sets bounds to the
expansion of the fluid acting as heat, it is natural to
think that it can be no other than the same fluid acting
in a contrary direction, or from a circumference towards
a centre; and thus we shall always find that the same
fluid, by limiting its own operations, may produce those
phenomena which have been hitherto deemed so difficult
of explanation. In what manner this limitation is
in all cases effected, or indeed in any case, we cannot
pretend to explain. It is sufficient to observe, that
wherever there is a perpetual <i>efflux</i> of any thing, there
must be also a perpetual <i>influx</i> at the same time, and in
proportion to the one the other will be. These two are
directly contrary to one another, and, as we suppose the
fluid to be universal, it is evident, that if any part of it
be put in motion in a particular direction, the rest will
press towards that part where the motion is, in order to
keep up the equilibrium. Hence we may easily account
for the heat produced by percussion or by friction. By
hammering a piece of iron, as Dr. Black justly observes,
the fluid is forced out from between the parts of the
metal. The emission of this fluid in all directions is
heat itself; and no sooner is one quantity thrown out than
another supplies its place with great rapidity, and so on,
until the pressure of the rest in some way or other counteracts
the emission of any more, and the heat ceases.
Just so with friction. The heat produced by it is always
in proportion to the pressure employed. By this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
pressure the parts of the two substances are forced into
such close contact, that an agitation and emission of the
fluid pervading their substance takes place. This agitation,
as we have already noticed, is heat itself, and, as
long as the friction is continued, more and more heat
will be produced, without any limitation, as Count Rumford
has observed.</p>

<p>Some bodies have a greater disposition than others to
emit this subtile fluid; and these we say are naturally
of a warmer temperature than others. The <i>temperature</i>
is nothing else than the efflux of the fluid from them,
continually kept up by the action of the surrounding
fluid. By mixture with different substances the
temperatures of various bodies may be changed; by
some the influx, and by others the efflux, may be augmented.
In the former case we say the body becomes
colder, in the latter hotter, than before; and in not a
few cases the agitation of the fluid becomes so great that
the matter actually takes fire. In all these cases, however,
we can discover nothing more than the bare
fact, that so and so is the case. We know that the
bodies do grow hot by the convergence of the etherial
fluid towards them, and its emission from them; but
why it should converge or diverge we know not.</p>

<p>Thus much with regard to heat in general. We must
next consider another fluid which has very generally been
accounted the source and fountain of heat, viz. <i>air</i>.
This is indeed so much the source of heat in all our
operations, that it was natural to think it the only one;
but experiments have now determined that air itself
is a mere creature of heat and light<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> for, by employing
these in a proper manner, airs or gases of all
kinds have been produced. Thus, by exposing water in
a glass vessel for some time to the rays of the sun, a
quantity of very pure oxygen air may be obtained; by
concentrating the sun’s rays upon charcoal, inflammable
air may be had; and by distilling, with a strong heat,
substances of various kinds, we may obtain a great variety
of aerial vapours. From all this we may reasonably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
conclude that heat, attached to some other substance,
dissolved in it in such a manner as to become
invisible, forms the substance of air. Heat therefore
being the agent in the composition of air, it is reasonable
to suppose that it is the agent in its decomposition
also, or in its transformation from one species to
another, of which the conversion of oxygen into fixed
air by combustion is an instance. When air is
taken into the lungs the blood is warmed by the
action of that invisible fluid, which has already given
elasticity to the air. In consequence of a considerable
quantity of this fluid being then converted from
a latent into a sensible state, part of the elastic principle
must be lost, and the air diminished in bulk. The reason
why this must constantly take place is, that part of
the heat evaporates from the surface of the body, during
the course of circulation. Were it not so, the quantity
thrown out by the lungs would be exactly equal to that
which the blood received, and consequently there could
be no diminution between the bulk of the air expired
and that which was inspired; but, on account of the
waste just mentioned, the blood must always receive
somewhat more than it gives out by the breath. Thus,
while the air we breathe continues the same, and the organization
of the body is not changed, the natural operations
will go on smoothly, and health will continue;
but, as we have formerly observed, by an alteration of
either of these, disease must ensue; and we must now
endeavour, from the principles laid down, to examine
the mode in which epidemic diseases, and particularly
the plague, may be produced.</p>

<p>The air is so evidently connected with human life, that
it has been from the earliest ages accounted the source
of pestilential diseases, though, as none of the more obvious
qualities of it, such as heat, cold, moisture, or
dryness, appeared to be connected with them, they were
generally supposed to proceed from the action of some
unknown natural cause, or from that of the Deity himself.
Some, however, have also been of opinion that
plagues might originate from the obvious qualities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the air in conjunction with certain effluvia from putrid
vegetable or animal bodies. Thus, in several plagues
mentioned in ancient history, we find swarms of dead
locusts, grasshoppers, the carcases of those slain in battle,
crowded houses, and filth of all kinds, assigned as
causes. This opinion was adopted by Dr. Mead, and
he gives the following account of the origin of the
plague in Egypt. “Grand Cairo is crowded with inhabitants,
who for the most part live very poorly and
nastily; the streets are narrow and close; it is situate
in a sandy plain, at the foot of a mountain, which,
by keeping off the winds that would refresh the air,
makes the heats very stifling. Through the midst of
the city passes a great canal, which is filled with water
at the overflowing of the Nile; and, after the river
decreases, is gradually dried up: into this canal the
people throw all manner of carrion, filth, &amp;c. so that
the stench which arises from this and the mud together
is insufferably offensive. In this posture of things,
the plague every year preys upon the inhabitants, and
is only stopped when the Nile, by overflowing, washes
away this load of filth; the cold winds, which set in
at the same time, lending their assistance by purifying
the air.” He then proceeds to account for the plagues
in Ethiopia in the manner above related, viz. by the
prodigious swarms of locusts, which sometimes occasion
a famine by devouring the fruits of the earth, and, when
they happen to be cast by the winds into the sea, occasion
a pestilence; the putrefaction being heightened
by the intemperance of the climate, which here is
so great that it is infested with violent rains for three
or four months together; and it is particularly observed
of this country, that the plague usually invades it whenever
rains fall during the sultry heats of July and August.
He next takes notice of what the Arabians say
of the origin of the plague in Ethiopia, viz. that it is
brought on by unseasonable moistures, heats, and want of
winds. But, whatever truth may be in the account
given of the Ethiopic plagues, the testimonies already
produced in this treatise are sufficient to render it very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
doubtful, at least, whether the plague ever does originate
in Cairo, or any other place in Egypt. Besides, if
we once admit the existence of any thing as a cause adequate
to the production of a certain effect, wherever that
cause exists the effect ought certainly to follow, unless
where we plainly perceive something which prevents its
action. It is not fair reasoning to say that the action of
the cause is prevented by something unknown, for we
might as well say that this unknown something is the
cause originally, and acts only upon certain occasions, of
when it thinks proper. Now, if the filth of the canal
of Cairo be the cause of the plague in that city, it ought
to recur annually at the season when that filth exists in
greatest quantity, and in the most putrid slate. Nevertheless
we have the express testimony of Mr. Eyles Irwin,
that at the time he was in Cairo there had not been any
plague for seven years. The account he gives of it is a
kind of contrast to that above quoted from Dr. Mead.
“<i>Misir al Kaira</i>, says he, or the <i>City of Anguish</i>, so called
from the frequent visits which it has received from the
plague, but commonly called <i>Grand Cairo</i> by us, is situated
in lat. 30 degrees 3 minutes N. on an artificial
branch of the Nile. Old Cairo nearly faces the river;
but the new city is removed above a mile from it, and
approaches to the range of mountains which runs
through Upper Egypt, and abruptly breaks off here.
It is undoubtedly one of the finest cities in the east;
which, from the present style of architecture that reigns
among the orientals, is but a faint commendation.
The houses are in general built of stone, and, being
elevated to several stories, would make a grand appearance,
notwithstanding the inelegance of their
structure, were not the effect destroyed by the excessive
narrowness of the streets. This is one of the
causes to which the ingenious Dr. Mead ascribes the
birth of the plague in this capital; but experience
evinces that it arises from <i>foreign and adventitious</i> causes.
<i>There has not been a plague here these seven years</i>; which
is rendered more remarkable by the commencement
of the Russian war at the date of its cessation. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
one can account for this; though a year seldom passed
by before without a visit from it.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span></p>

<p>From this it plainly appears, that, however these putrid
effluvia may concur with other circumstances in producing
the plague, they are by no means the <i>only</i> cause;
otherwise not a single year could have passed in Cairo
without a pestilence; and the very same thing we shall
find to hold good in every other, let us choose for a
cause what we will. In order to investigate this matter
fully, we must now consider what causes have been assigned
by physicians for other epidemical diseases; and
here, to avoid prolixity, we shall chiefly confine ourselves
to those enumerated by Dr. Fordyce as the causes of
fever; a gentleman whose very extensive experience
must give the greatest weight to his testimony<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> The
principal causes assigned by him are,</p>

<p>1. <i>Infection</i>, or “a peculiar matter generated in the
body of a man in fever, which is carried by the atmosphere,
and applied to some part of the body of a
person in health, and which causes fever to take place
in him.” That such a cause exists, he proves from observing
that “of any number of men, one half of whom
go near a person ill of a fever, and the other half do not,
a greater number of the former will be infected, in a
short period afterwards, than in those who do not.”
He says he has known, in such circumstances, seven out
of nine infected with the disease. This infection is not
discoverable by smell or any other organ of sense; neither
can the greatest attention to cleanliness disarm it of
its malignity. Of this the Doctor says that he has known
instances; nay, of a person going into a room where a
feverish patient was, and bringing with him the infection,
which was communicated to others in the room to which
he came. He owns, however, that by allowing the air
to stagnate in which feverish patients are, the infection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
will become extremely violent and fatal. This may naturally
be supposed, even without having recourse to
putrid effluvia; because, independent of these, the imperceptible
infectious matter itself will undoubtedly be
accumulated in the atmosphere of the room, and act
more powerfully than it could have done had it been
partly carried off and diluted by attention to cleanliness
and ventilation. He also says, that “when a number
of persons live in a small space, supposing even that they
are kept as clean as possible, it happens frequently that
fever arises in some, often in many of them. It has
been in this case supposed, and is extremely probable,
that some peculiar species of matter is <i>produced</i>, capable
of producing fever, on being applied to the body.”</p>

<p>2. <i>Effluvia from putrid animal or vegetable matters.</i>
Of this our author seems to be less fully ascertained than
of the former, as he does not say that he has observed
any instances of fevers arising from this cause; and he
concludes by observing that “either the cause of fever,
consisting of matter produced in the body of a person
affected with this disease, seems probably different from
that produced by putrefaction, or might be generated
without any putrefaction taking place.”</p>

<p>3. <i>Cold.</i> Our author “is not disposed to allow that
sudden exposure to cold occasions fever to take place,
unless some symptom of the disease follows immediately.
If a man had been suddenly exposed to cold, and continued
in perfect health for <i>twenty-four</i> hours, the author
would never allow that fever, or any other disease,
was occasioned by it. In this case (exposure to cold)
the evidence is much stronger than in that of infection;
for the author (Dr. Fordyce) has seen many
instances where, from exposure to cold, the commencement
of the attack was instantaneous; and many are
to be found in the records of medicine.”</p>

<p>4. <i>Moisture.</i> On this subject the Doctor observes, that
the application of water to the body is not a cause of fever,
unless the air has particles of water floating in it; in
which case fever has ensued more frequently than in
other cases. Water may exist in the atmosphere in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
three states. 1. In small drops suspended in it like dust
in water. 2. In vapour. In this case the transparency
of the air is not impaired, and a <i>chemical</i> combination,
as it is called, between the air and water takes place.
If the atmosphere be hot or dense, it is capable of combining
chemically with a larger proportion of water. If
therefore the atmosphere should in this manner be saturated
with water, at any particular degree of heat or density,
by diminishing either of these the vapour will be
condensed, and the water reduced to the former state of
suspension in small particles. 3. Water, heated to the
boiling point, emits a steam, which combines chemically
with the atmosphere, till the latter be saturated, after
which it assumes the form of small particles; and <i>this
last is the only state</i> which has been found to produce fever.</p>

<p>Moisture will also produce fever when applied to the
body by wearing wet clothes. Those which imbibe or
part with heat most slowly, are least apt to produce fevers
on being heated. The warmer the atmosphere, the more
liable people are to fevers from moisture.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that moisture from marshes,
stagnating canals, or where the water runs very slowly,
is more apt to produce fevers than what proceeds from
the sea, lakes or rapid rivers. “This (says the Doctor)
has given occasion to suppose that some other vapours
proceed from such marshes beside water, and produce
the disease. It certainly often happens, that a considerable
degree of putrefaction takes place in marshy
grounds, and more especially in warm climates; but
it is by no means to be concluded that moisture in the
atmosphere always produces fever in consequence of
putrefaction. Putrefaction can only take place in vegetable
or animal substances. If water therefore, not
impregnated with either, should be in such a situation
as to produce moisture in the atmosphere, no putrefaction
can take place; therefore, if fevers ensue, they
are certainly in consequence of moisture, not putrefaction.
Many instances of this may be brought, as in
the war which took place in Flanders, between the
tenth and eleventh year of the present century, an army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
encamped upon sandy ground, in which water was
found in digging less than a foot deep, and occasioned
a great moisture in the air, which produced in a few
days numbers of fevers, although the army was perfectly
healthy before, and no more fevers were produced
on shifting their ground. There are a vast many
other instances of the same thing having taken place.
Besides, fever has often arisen immediately in persons
sitting in rooms, the floors of which had been just
moistened with pure water.”</p>

<p>5. <i>Certain kinds of food.</i> On this Dr. Fordyce observes,
that, though food of difficult digestion undoubtedly
produces a number of diseases, he has never seen it
productive of fever excepting once. Dr. Girtanner relates,
that the emperor of Germany, having forced a
number of his subjects to serve as soldiers, and sent them
into an unwholsome part of Walachia, where he fed
them with a kind of paste made of bread and water instead
of meat, many of them died of the scurvy. The
Doctor, however, does not ascribe this to any positive
cause, but to three <i>negatives</i>, viz. the abstraction of the
stimulus of <i>nutriment</i>, by feeding on the paste just mentioned;
of the stimulus of <i>oxygen</i> in the corrupted atmosphere
of Walachia; and lastly of the <i>nervous stimulus</i>,
the most powerful of all; the greatest part being engaged
by force against their will. This corroborates what Dr.
Fordyce has said, that bad food is very seldom the cause
of fever; for among so many, who used the <i>imperial</i>
paste just mentioned, some would certainly have been
affected by fevers, had it been capable of producing
them; but, as it did not, it is most evident that the
deficiency of <i>stimuli</i> is not the cause of fever.</p>

<p>6. <i>Passions of the mind.</i> These are looked upon by
Dr. Fordyce to be among the less frequent causes of
fever, though it is certain that they have been productive
of multitudes of diseases, and even of sudden
deaths; and Dr. Falconer, in his Prize Dissertation,
ascribes to the passions very considerable effects in fevers,
and even in the plague itself. “Contagious fevers
(says he) afford strong instances of the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
of mental affections, both as prophylactics and remedies.
The plague is a remarkable example, and the
same reasoning extends to other disorders of a febrile,
contagious nature. Fear, it is well observed by Dr.
Cullen, by weakening the body, and thereby increasing
its irritability, is one of the causes which, concurring
with contagion, render it more certainly active,
which he ascribes to its weakening effect on the body,
by which its irritability is increased. Against this
therefore he directs the mind to be particularly fortified,
which is best done by giving people a favourable
idea of the power of preservative means, and by destroying
the opinion of the incurable nature of the
disorder, by occupying the mind with business or labour,
and by avoiding all objects of fear, as funerals,
passing-bells, and any notice of the death of particular
friends. Even charms might be used with good effect,
could we promote a strong prepossession of their efficacy,
either by the confidence they inspire, or by their
engrossing the attention of the mind. It is no less
certain, that a studious regard to promote hope and
confidence in recovery, is equally necessary for the
cure as for the prevention of such disorders. We
know that contagious fevers have a peculiar tendency
to diminish the energy of the brain, and of course to
debilitate the whole system; and that this is especially
the case with the plague, which produces the most considerable
effects in weakening the <span class="nowrap">nervous<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> system or
moving powers, and in disposing the fluids to a general
putrescency; and Dr. Cullen is of opinion that to these
circumstances, as the proximate causes of the plague,
regard should chiefly be had, both for the prevention
and cure of this disorder. It must therefore be highly
necessary, during the course of this disease, to attend
to the support of the spirits, as on these the vital principles
greatly depend; and they can by no means be
so effectually kept up as by inspiring a confidence of
recovery.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>
<p>Dr. Zimmerman presents us with a great number of
examples of the influence of the passions in producing
diseases, or death itself; some of the most remarkable of
which follow. “All the passions (says he) when carried
to excess, bring on very formidable diseases. Sometimes
they occasion death, or bring us at least into
imminent danger. The most reputable physicians agree
in opinion that terror may occasion apoplexy, and
death; and indeed they consider apoplexy as the most
common effect of violent passion. Without being
carried to excess, a passion will sometimes occasion a
difficulty of breathing, together with a sense of stricture
in the breast, and an hesitation to speak; the
tongue remaining as it were immoveably fixed on the
palate. Hysterical and hypocondriacal affections are
sometimes the effects of grief in the most healthy people.
Joy is much more dangerous to life than sudden
grief. Sophocles died through joy at being crowned
on account of a tragedy he had composed in his old
age. The famous Fouquet died on being told that
Louis XIV had restored him to liberty. The niece of
the celebrated Leibnitz, not suspecting that a philosopher
would hoard up treasure, died suddenly on
finding under her uncle’s bed a box containing sixty
thousand ducats. Violent anger has sometimes produced
hæmorrhages and subcutaneous extravasations;
or, some vessel of the brain being ruptured by these
transports, a fatal apoplexy has taken place. There
have been instances of excessive anger being succeeded
by epilepsy, colic, or a violent degree of fever. Sometimes
it has occasioned an increased flow of bile. In
some this produces vomiting; in others it goes off
downwards, and causes diarrhœa; or being retained,
from a stricture of the gall-ducts, will perhaps be absorbed,
and occasion jaundice. In cases where anger
has been succeeded by extreme grief, obstructions have
taken place in the liver. The effects of terror are
similar to those of anger, but in general more violent.
Sometimes excessive terror seems to give to men a preternatural
strength, as is the case with madmen and drowning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
persons. In some cases it has not only excited immediate
convulsions, but caused them to return periodically.
Fear has been said to make the hair stand
upright, and to contract the pores from which the hairs
issue in the same manner as cold does. There are instances
in authors even of the colour of the hair being
changed by excessive fright. Philip V died
suddenly on being told that the Spaniards had been
defeated, and, on opening him, his heart was found
ruptured. Timid people are more liable than others
to fall sick. A firmness of mind is one of the best
preservations against contagion. Willis has very well
observed, that they who fear the small-pox the most
are generally the first to be attacked with it. Cheyne
assures us that fear is extremely prejudicial in all epidemical
diseases. Dr. Rogers remarks, that fear constantly
increases the ravages of a contagious disease.
Rivinus attributed the propagation of the plague at
Leipsic wholly to fear. The French physicians, who
wrote on the plague at Marseilles, went so far as to
deny its being contagious, and ascribed its propagation
chiefly to fear.”</p>

<p>As for the cause of the plague itself, Dr. Fordyce supposes
it to be produced by an infection of a particular
kind. That which takes place in Syria and Egypt, he
says, has only been clearly described by Dr. Russel; and
it cannot be gathered from the accounts whether this
may be originally produced without having been propagated
as the first class of infections above mentioned are.
“That disease (says he) called the plague, which ravaged
this country (England) on considering the histories of
the disease, seems to have been a <i>fever</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> produced by
infections of the first class which have been enumerated.”
Dr. Moore has given an account of the origin
of a plague, which, if it could be depended upon,
would decide the question concerning the origin of this
dreadful distemper without previous infection. This
passage is extracted from the History of the Royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Medical Society for the years 1777 and 1778. “Dr.
Mitchell, physician to the hospital at Smyrna, appears,
according to a memoir of which he is the author,
sent by M. le Baron de Tott to the Medical
Society to believe in the spontaneity of the plague
(or that it arises of itself without any predisposing
cause in the body) for proof of which he cites the
following circumstance: A solitary shepherd, having
no communication with any body, fell sick while he
was tending his flocks; he went into an inhabited
part, where he communicated the plague with which he
found that he was attacked. This circumstance would
prove much, if it was certain that the shepherd had
no communication with others; if it were known how
long, and with what precaution, he had been secluded
from company: but the proofs of these are too difficult
to be established to allow of any conclusion to be
drawn from the fact. We are obliged therefore to acknowledge
[it to be a doubtful matter] whether it is
in fact a country that is the cradle of the plague;
what country this is, supposing that such an one exists;
or, finally, whether it sometimes appears spontaneously,
and whether the first whom it attacks becomes
the focus from whence it emanates.”</p>

<p>Dr. Fordyce, in treating of the origin of fever, seems
inclined to think that it may arise without any predisposing
cause; and after having enumerated the various
causes already mentioned, and fully considered them,
gives it as his opinion, that “there must undoubtedly
be other causes than those which give occasion to the
disease, but which are at present <i>totally unknown</i>.”
In like manner Dr. Moore, speaking of the nervous
fever, sums up what may be known concerning the
cause of it in the following words. “Upon the whole,
we know that people of delicate, exhausted and sickly
constitutions, and those whose minds are saddened by
depressing passions, are greatly predisposed to this disease,
the immediate seeds of which, we also know,
may be generated in places where human effluvia are
collected and confined. And this is the most essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
part of our knowledge respecting the cause of this
disease; and even this little is disturbed with uncertainty:
for we sometimes meet with instances of people
of <i>robust constitutions</i>, who are seized with the disease
in all its malignity, when they are under no <i>depressing
passion</i>, when the disease is <i>not epidemic</i>, to
whom we cannot trace it from any place where the
human effluvia could be confined in any uncommon
degree, or from any person in the disease, of which
perhaps there is no other person ill in the neighbourhood
for several miles round; and, in short, when we
cannot connect it with any of the causes supposed to
be the sources of the distemper. On extraordinary
occasions of this kind we have nothing for it but to
suppose that, notwithstanding the apparent vigour of
the patient, his body has been peculiarly predisposed
to catch the infection, and that some contagion, not
forcible enough to infect any other person, has by some
means, unobserved, been conveyed to him; or, if so
many suppositions displease, we may suppose at once
that there is in some cases a source of this fever which
has not been suspected. For, although the numerous
observations that have been made give us the strongest
reason to think that human effluvia produce this disease,
we have no right to infer that it cannot arise also
from some other source.”</p>

<p>To the same purpose I subjoin the very respectable
opinion and testimony of Dr. Patrick Russel. “In some
epidemical distempers, the sudden alternations of the
air have constant and manifest influence; in others,
though the influence of the air must be equally admitted,
it seems not to depend on sensible alteration
or succession in the common properties of the atmosphere,
but on some <i>inexplicable</i> combination, some
<i>occult, new, unknown</i> quality. Amongst epidemics of
this last kind must be reckoned the plague.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Should
ever that state of the air, without the concurrence
of which the contagion of the pestilence never
spreads, or ceases to act, be discovered, and ascertained
by unequivocal marks, the dread of the plague,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
universally prevalent, would be greatly diminished;
more effectual means of preservation would be found
out, and the application of them might safely be limited
to certain seasons.</p>

<p>“Experience in Turky, where, generally, no precautions
are taken in the times of pestilence, clearly evinces,
that, in a certain state of the air, a communication
with infected places may subsist without any material
consequence. The return of the plague at Aleppo
happens at irregular periods; the intervals are of considerable,
but unequal, length; and in those the commerce
with Egypt, Constantinople and Smyrna remains
uninterrupted. In the intervals between 1744
1760, and from 1762 to 1780, the plague raged several
times in the places now mentioned, without affecting
Aleppo; and even in two or three years subsequent
to 1762, though it was at Marash, as well as
other places not far distant, with which Aleppo has
continual intercourse, no instances were discovered of
communicated infection: if such happened, they must
have escaped my utmost vigilance; and the daily
exercise of my profession led me to be very much
among the natives of all ranks. At the same time I
have reason to suspect that infected families from some
of those places took refuge in Aleppo; and I know,
with certainty, that not only some merchants of that
city, who happened to be at Marash when the plague
broke out there, returned to their families in the summer
of 1763, but that caravans of various merchandise
arrived in the course of the same summer.</p>

<p>“I consider it therefore as an established fact in the
Levant, that commerce and intercourse with infected
towns is sometimes attended with no bad consequence.
The same thing may perhaps be asserted, without
restriction, of all countries; but till the signs indicating
a pestilential constitution be ascertained, no particular
year can be declared exempt from danger. Predictions
founded on <i>planetary conjunctions</i> have been
long exploded; and signs derived from the known
properties and alterations of the air, are almost equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
fallacious. The seasons concomitant with plagues in
England, as well as elsewhere, have been very dissimilar;
and the same visible concurrence, usually deemed
pestilential, has often, in the revolution of years, been
observed to return, in various countries, without producing
the dreaded consequences. Upon the whole,
from all I have been able to collect, the pestilential
constitution seems hitherto to be known only from its
effects; <i>neither its approach nor its retreat can be predicted
and its nature remains wrapped up in</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">MYSTERIOUS
DARKNESS</span>.”</p>

<p>Having thus seen, that, of the causes commonly assigned
for epidemical diseases, not one can be accounted
certain and determinate, it now remains to consider one
more, and that is</p>

<p><i>Contagion.</i> Though this has been generally accounted
the same with <i>infection</i>, yet by some it has been reckoned
otherwise; and indeed there seems to be a necessity
for such a distinction; for, though we should prove,
ever so clearly, that a disease once communicated to one
person should from that person be communicated to another,
yet the difficulty is to know from whence the first
person had it. This source, if any such can be found,
is what we may with the greatest propriety distinguish by
the name of <i>contagion</i>, and is the sense in which it shall
for the future be used in this treatise, the matter communicated
from one person to another being always called
<i>infection</i>. This indeed differs from what many celebrated
physicians have said upon the subject; but the distinction
certainly must exist. Dr. Cullen speaks rather indistinctly
upon the subject. “We have supposed that
<i>miasmata</i> are the cause of intermittents, and <i>contagions</i>
the cause of continued fevers, strictly so named; but
we cannot with propriety employ these general terms.
The notion of <i>contagion</i> properly implies a matter arising
from the body under disease, <i>miasma</i>, a matter
arising from other substances. But, as the cause of
continued fevers may arise from other substances than
the human body, and may in such cases be called a
<i>miasma</i>, and, as other miasmata also may produce contagious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
disorders, it will be proper to distinguish the
cause of fevers by using the terms <i>marsh</i>, or <i>human</i> effluvia,
rather than the general ones <i>miasma</i>, or <i>contagion</i>.”</p>

<p>From this it is not very easy to determine what the
Doctor means when he speaks of <i>specific contagion</i> as the
cause of the plague. Dr. Russel plainly ascribes it to
human effluvia. “The plague (says he) is a contagious
disease; that is, an <i>emanation from a body diseased</i>, passing
into one which is sound, produces, in time, the
same disease,” &amp;c. There must, however, undoubtedly
have been something originally distinct from the
human body which gave rise at least to the <i>first</i> plague
that was in the world; and some plagues recorded in
history are said to have arisen in this way. Thus, Ammianus
Marcellinus says that the plague which broke out
in the Roman army in the time of Marcus Aurelius
arose from a pestilential vapour confined in a golden coffer
dedicated to Apollo. Upon opening this, the <i>contagion</i>
diffused itself all around, and the <i>infection</i> spreading
from one to another, produced an almost universal pestilence.
Ammianus indeed is the only historian who
relates this; another account of its origin is given, p.
14, but whether we believe the account of Ammianus
or not (which indeed does not appear probable) it is sufficient
to show what were the received opinions at the
time. In like manner every one has heard of pestilential
effluvia breaking out from the earth, from graves, &amp;c.
so that we certainly look upon this doctrine of <i>contagion</i>
as the cause of diseases to have been pretty generally received.
We are also informed by Dr. Mead, from M.
Villani, who wrote the history of those times, that the
great plague of 1346 began in China, where, according
to the report of some Genoese sailors, it was occasioned
by a great ball of fire that either burst out of the earth,
or fell down from heaven. This is thought incredible
by Dr. Mead, and no doubt is so, but it shows the general
opinion, that the original cause or <i>contagion</i> which
produces a plague is distinct from the <i>infection</i> which is
afterwards communicated from one to another. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
French Encyclopedie, we have this account of the ball
of fire, or fiery vapour, without any comment.</p>

<p>As to the opinion of pestilential vapours arising out of
the earth, though we are assured that people have been
suddenly killed by explosions, probably of the electrical
kind, or by lightning issuing from under their feet, yet
we are not furnished with any well authenticated accounts
of a <i>plague</i> having arisen from any such cause.
About 19 years ago a violent fever raged epidemically
through a small district in the north of Scotland, which
was said to have originated in the following manner.
Some young men having heard that a certain place in
their neighbourhood had, in the time of a plague been a
burial ground, took into their heads to dig into it.
They did so, and one of them immediately fell sick, but
recovered. The father of two of the young men, exceedingly
displeased at the conduct of his sons, and apprehensive
of the consequences, filled up the hole they had
dug in the ground, soon after which he fell sick and died,
and the fever continued to rage in the neighbourhood
for some time. The mother of another of the parties
concerned also died, and boils broke out on various
parts of the bodies of the sick. This was the account
given in some of the news-papers of the time, and had
the matter been thoroughly investigated and attested,
would have been decisive in favour of pestilential contagion
being capable of taking up its residence in the
earth. As it stands at present, it can only draw our attention
to what may happen in another case, should any
similar one occur<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>
<p>With regard to epidemics occasioned by the action of
electricity, we cannot indeed produce any instance; but
we have one of a distemper more dreadful than even the
plague itself; and that is of a person suddenly struck by
an electric flash (generated either in his own body, or
in the room where he was) and by this stroke reduced
to a most deplorable condition, which soon ended in
death. The account stands on the authority of Mr.
Joseph Battaglia, surgeon at Ponte Bosio, who transmitted
it to Florence, and is as follows.</p>

<p>“Don G. Maria Bertholi, a priest residing at mount
Valere in the district of Livizzano, went to the fair
of Filetto, on account of some business which he had
to transact, and after spending the whole day in going
about through the neighbouring country, in order to
execute commissions, in the evening he walked towards
Fenille, and stopped at the house of one of his
brothers-in-law, who resided there. No sooner had he
arrived, than he desired to be conducted to his apartment,
where he put a handkerchief between his shoulders
and his shirt, and, when every body retired, he
began to repeat his breviary. A few minutes after, a
loud noise was heard in Mr. Bertholi’s chamber; and
his cries having alarmed the family, they hastened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
the spot, where they found him extended on the floor,
and surrounded by a faint flame, which retired to a
greater distance in proportion as it was approached,
and at length disappeared entirely. Having conveyed
him to bed, such assistance as seemed necessary was
given him. Next morning I was called, and after
examining the patient carefully, I found that the teguments
of the right arm were almost entirely detached
from the flesh, and hanging loose, as well as the skin
of the lower part of it. In the space contained between
the shoulders and the thigh, the teguments were
as much injured as those of the right arm. The first
thing, therefore, to be done, was to take away those
pieces of skin; and, perceiving that a mortification was
begun in that part of the right hand which had received
the greatest hurt, I scarified it without loss of time;
but notwithstanding this precaution, I found it next
day, as I had suspected the preceding evening, entirely
sphacelous. On my third visit, all the other wounded
parts appeared to be in the same condition. The patient
complained of an ardent thirst, and was agitated
with dreadful convulsions. He voided by stool bilious
putrid matter, and was distressed by a continual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
vomiting, accompanied with a violent fever and delirium.
At length the fourth day after a comatose
sleep of two hours, he expired. During my last visit,
while he was sunk in the lethargic sleep of which I have
spoken, I observed with astonishment, that putrefaction
had already made so great progress, that his
body exhaled an insupportable smell. I saw the
worms which issued from it crawling on the bed,
and the nails of his fingers drop of themselves; so
that I thought it needless to attempt any thing farther,
while he was in this deplorable condition. Having taken
care to get every possible information from the patient
himself, respecting what had happened to him, he told
me, that he had felt a stroke, as if somebody had given
him a blow over the right arm, with a large club, and
that at the same time, he had seen a spark of fire attach
itself to his shirt, which in a moment was reduced to
ashes, though the fire did not in the least injure the wrist-bands.
The handkerchief which he had placed upon
his shoulders, between his shirt and his skin, was perfectly
entire, without the least appearance of burning,
his drawers were untouched, but his night-cap was destroyed,
though a single hair of his head was not hurt.
That this flame under the form of elementary fire,
burnt the skin, reduced the shirt to ashes, and entirely
consumed the night-cap, without in the least touching
the hair, is a fact which I affirm to be true: besides,
every symptom that appeared on the body of the deceased,
announced severe burning. The night was
calm, and the circumambient air very pure: no bituminous
smell could be perceived in the chamber, nor
was there the least trace of fire or of smoke. A lamp,
however, which had been full of oil, was found dry,
and the wick almost in ashes. We cannot reasonably
suppose this fatal accident to have been occasioned by
any external cause; and I have no doubt that if
Maffei were still alive he would take advantage of it
to support an opinion which he entertained, that lightning
is sometimes kindled in the human body and
destroys it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>Another account, to the same purpose, is given in
Mr. Battaglia’s paper. “On the 21st of April, 1781,
the first battalion of the brigade of Savoy set out from
Tortona, in order to go to Arti, when the weather was
excessively hot. On the 22d, having made rather a
forced march, the soldiers suffered a great deal from
the ardour of the sun, so that, at the village of Serre,
where they halted, one of them, named Bocquet, a
man of twenty-five years of age, whose skin being very
hard and thick had not perspired, sent forth a loud
cry, which seemed to announce some extraordinary
commotion, and instantly fell down. Mr. Bianet,
surgeon major to the regiment, found the patient in
convulsions. When he was carried to the hospital
the upper part of his body, to the thighs, appeared to
be withered and black, and in a gangrenous state.
Mr. Bianet employed scarifications, but without effect;
it was impossible to make him swallow any
thing; and it was found necessary to abandon him to
his dismal fate. His body soon exhaled a putrid
smell, and he died at the end of five hours. That his
disorder might not be communicated to others, he
was interred together with his clothes. Upon inquiry,
after his death, it was found that this man was
addicted to the constant use of spiritous liquors, and
that he had even drank of them to excess upon the
march.”</p>

<p>Other instances there are, still more terrible, of people
actually taking fire and being consumed to ashes by
some internal cause; but, as nobody was present either
at the beginning or during the continuance of these extraordinary
inflammations, nothing certain can be said
about them. That such things, however, have happened,
is certain, of which one of the most remarkable
instances is that of Signora Corn. Zangari, an Italian
lady. She retired to her chamber in the evening somewhat
indisposed, and in the morning was found in the
middle of the room reduced to ashes, all except her face,
legs, skull and three fingers. The stockings and shoes
she had on were not burnt in the least. The ashes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
light, and on pressing them between the fingers vanished,
leaving behind a gross, stinking moisture,
with which the floor was smeared; the walls and furniture
of the room being covered with a moist cineritious
soot, which had not only stained the linen in the
chests, but had penetrated into the closet, as well as into
the room overhead, the walls of which were moistened
with the same viscous humour. This lady had been
accustomed to use a bath of camphorated spirit of wine
when indisposed.</p>

<p>Dr. Zimmerman, from the 64th volume of the Philosophical
Transactions, relates the case of a poor woman
who perished in this miserable manner at Coventry
in England in the year 1772. “She fell out of bed,
and was found next morning burnt to death, though
the fire in the grate had been small, and the furniture
in the room had suffered but little. Except one
thigh and leg, there were not the least remains of any
skin, vessels or viscera; and the greater part of the
bones were completely calcined, and covered with a
whitish efflorescence.”</p>

<p>On these unfortunate people it has been observed
that they were generally intemperate in the use of spiritous
liquors. Of the poor woman at Coventry, whose case
has been just now related, it is said, that she had been
in the practice of drinking from half a pint to a quart
of rum every day, and this she continued, notwithstanding
her being affected with jaundice and other complaints.
Mr. Wilmer, who communicated this case to the Royal
Society, concludes it with these words: “That her
solids and fluids were rendered inflammable by the
immense quantity of spiritous liquors she had drank,
and when she was set fire to she was probably soon
reduced to ashes.”</p>

<p>On other cases of a similar nature it has been remarked,
that the miserable sufferers were “for the most
part advanced in years, remarkably fat, and had been
much addicted to the use of spiritous liquors, either
in their drink, or applied in friction to the body;
whence it has been concluded that these people perished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
by their whole substance spontaneously taking
fire, the principal seat of which had been the entrails,
or the epigastric viscera; and that the exciting cause
was naturally found in the phlogiston of the humours,
called forth by that of the spiritous liquors
combined with them.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> But solutions of this kind
cannot by any means be admitted. We have not the
smallest reason to think that either the solid or fluid
parts of the bodies of hard drinkers are more inflammable
than those of other people; neither is it credible that
any person could live with his body in such a state. Besides,
the most inflammable bodies will not begin to
burn unless fire actually be applied to them, while others
much less inflammable to appearance, will yet take fire
spontaneously. Thus, even spiritous liquors themselves,
though they flame violently when thrown into a fire, or
when a burning body is applied to them, yet there is
not an instance of such liquors taking fire of themselves;
nay, they cannot even be set on fire by pouring them upon
a red-hot iron, while, on the other hand, heaps of
wet vegetables, which we should think scarce at all inflammable,
do yet very frequently take fire spontaneously.
The author lately quoted, however, justly observes that
M. Bartholi, the unfortunate priest above mentioned was
plainly struck first by electricity from without, a spark of
fire attaching itself to his shirt, and a faint flame surrounding
his body; so that the fire did not seem to have
been generated in his body, but in the atmosphere.
There are instances of people being surrounded with these
luminous appearances without being hurt; particularly
of a woman at Milan, whose bed was surrounded with
a light of this kind. Mr. Loammi Baldwin, of this
country, was also surrounded by an electric light, while
raising a kite in the time of a thunder storm, and Dr.
Priestley makes mention of a gentleman, who, after having
worked an electric machine for a long time in a
small room, perceived, on leaving it, a luminous vapour
following him. But the instances most to our present
purpose are some recorded in the Philosophical Transactions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of luminous vapours coming from the sea, attaching
themselves to corn-stacks, and setting fire to them.
One of this kind is particularly mentioned in Lowthorp’s
Abridgement of the Transactions, as having taken place
in Ireland, coming repeatedly from the sea, and setting
fire to corn and hay, so that the people were greatly
alarmed. At last they found that it might be driven
off by making a great noise, and that it would avoid any
sharp-pointed iron instrument. Had such a vapour attached
itself to a human body, it is possible that it might
have set fire to it as well as to the stack of corn or hay.
Whether these accounts render the story of the Genoese
sailors concerning the ball of fire occasioning the plague
of 1346 more credible, we leave the reader to judge.
They certainly show, however, that the electric fluid will
sometimes interfere with the human body in a very terrible
manner, producing, where it does not kill instantaneously,
symptoms equal to those of the very worst
plague, as in the case of the priest and soldier above
mentioned.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis concerning the origin of pestilential
diseases is that of swarms of little animals invisibly
existing in the atmosphere; which, being taken into the
body by the breath, are supposed to corrupt or otherwise
vitiate the blood and other parts of the body, as we
see in the plague and other epidemic disorders. This
hypothesis, so generally exploded, and so apparently improbable,
seems to receive some support from a discovery
of an insect made by Mr. Henry Baker, F. R.&nbsp;S. and published
in his work entitled “The Microscope made Easy.”
He called it the insect with net-like arms. “It
lives (says he) only in cascades, where the water runs
very swift. Some of them being kept in a vial of water,
most died in two days, and the rest, having spun themselves
transparent cases, which were fastened either to
the sides of the glass, or to pieces of grass put into it,
seemed to be changed into a kind of chrysalis; but
before they assumed this form, they altered their shape
(in a manner he represents by a figure.) None of them
lived above three days; and, though fresh water was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
given them two or three times a day, yet in a few hours
it would stink to a degree scarce conceivable, and that
too at several yards distance, though, in proportion to the
water, all the included insects were not more than as
one to <i>one million, an hundred and fifty thousand</i>. This
makes it probable that it is necessary for them to live
in a rapid stream, lest they should be poisoned by the
effluvia issuing from their own bodies, as no doubt
they were in the vial.”</p>

<p>From this account it is not difficult to conceive that
animals, though exceedingly small, may yet emit such
poisonous effluvia as will destroy much larger ones in
their neighbourhood. It will by no means be incredible
that, had one or two such offensive animals been
thrown into a jar containing gold-fishes<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> the whole of
these beautiful inhabitants would have perished at once.
Let us suppose such a thing to have actually happened;
that a malicious person had put them in over night, and
in the morning the proprietor of the fishes finds them all
dead, and the water offensive to the last degree. He
sends for a neighbouring philosopher, who, happening to
be ignorant of the existence of such animals, endeavours
to account for the phenomenon upon some of the received
principles of philosophy. How much theory would
here be wasted, and what endless disputes might ensue
without even a <i>possibility</i> of arriving at the truth! Just so
it is with epidemic diseases. The cause is invisible, and,
until it becomes discoverable by our senses, it can never
be known; for, as has already been observed, a cause
never can be known merely by its effects, unless we have
seen it, or somebody who has seen it gives us information.
And this will certainly be found to hold good in
every instance, even from the Supreme Cause himself to
the diminutive insect just mentioned.</p>

<p>Lastly, I shall consider another <i>possible</i> source of epidemics,
which has been hinted at by others. Allowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
that infectious matter proceeds from the body of a diseased
person, as much must issue from a single patient
as is sufficient to bring the disease upon thousands, and
with regard to the small-pox and some other distempers
we certainly know that it is so. This infection is dissipated
in the atmosphere, and intimately combined with
it, so that it becomes imperceptible and harmless; but
we have no reason to suppose that it is annihilated, or
cannot be re-produced in its pristine state. Water,
though perfectly dissolved, and to appearance deprived
of existence in the air, may yet be precipitated from it,
and pour down upon us in deluges. What happens in
one case may happen in another. The infectious matter,
dissolved in the air, may by some natural cause be
precipitated from it, overshadowing whole regions, and,
if it be not powerful enough to produce the epidemic of
itself, may certainly <i>predispose</i> to it in such a degree,
that the slightest additional cause will bring it on.</p>

<p>Something indeed of this kind would seem really to
be the case, otherwise we cannot well conceive why there
should be such a distinction of diseases. Thus the infection
of the small-pox is the same all over the world.
The variolous matter will never produce the measles in
any country, nor will the typhus produce a pleurisy.
The plague manifests itself to be the same distemper in
all its various degrees of malignity, though even this
dreadful disease is sometimes so mild that it does not
confine the patient to his bed. There must therefore be
some certain constitution in the nature of the cause
which produces such and such diseases, as certainly as in
the seed of particular vegetables, which gives to each its
proper appearance and shape. The cause of the disease
so modified we may call, with Dr. Cullen, its <i>specific
contagion</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus treated so largely upon contagion of
different kinds, it now remains to consider the objections
that have been made to the doctrine altogether. It is
indeed surprising that in so great a length of time, after
the world hath so often and so dreadfully suffered from
the violence of plagues, the simple fact, whether it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
infectious or not, should not have been determined:
nay, that it should still be questioned by physicians of
no mean reputation whether such a thing as contagion
or infection <i>can possibly exist</i>. Dr. Mosely in his treatise
on tropical diseases treats the whole doctrine of contagion
with the utmost contempt; calling it “a field for
speculation, which has long amused the pedantry of
the schools, and should never be entered into by practical
writers.” Notwithstanding this, however, he
doth enter into it, and with such bad success, that in the
very first paragraph he is obliged to derive the cause of
diseases from the stars! “There are some diseases we
know, (says he) which follow the changes of the atmosphere;
but there are others which make their
revolutions, and visit the earth, at uncertain periods;
for which we can trace no cause, depending on combinations,
in which, perhaps, the <i>influence of the planets</i>
may have some share.” Here we have a still wider
field for speculation than even <i>the schools</i> have given us;
for the Doctor ought to remember that the influence of
a <i>planet</i>, producing a disease, is as truly contagion as
the effluvia of a <i>dunghill</i>; and if we have a wide field
to traverse when tracing it through the earth, we have
one infinitely more extensive in pursuing it through the
heavens. But we may be assured that planetary influence
<i>does not</i> produce diseases; for, if it did, they would
in all times of pestilence overspread the face of the earth,
as the influence of the planets, if they have any, certainly
does.</p>

<p>The arguments used by this author against <i>terrestrial</i>
contagion are,</p>

<p>1. “It has often happened that hundreds of men in
a camp have been seized with the dysentery, almost
at the same time, after one shower of rain, &amp;c. People
under similar circumstances must be subject to
similar diseases: and yet it often happens that dysentery
begins with a few people, and spreads itself by
degrees until a multitude are affected.”</p>

<p>This argument rather militates against himself; for,
if dysentery or any other disease was occasioned by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
<i>evident</i> general cause operating upon persons in similar
circumstances, all of them ought to be taken ill at once;
but Dr. Mosely owns that they frequently are not.
There must, of consequence, be something <i>less evident</i>
which determines the disease to particular persons, while
the general cause operates equally upon all. This less
evident cause we call <i>contagion</i>.</p>

<p>2. “It is incredible that the smelling a little human
blood, that had stood some months in a phial, gave
the man a dysentery mentioned by Pringle; or that the
person Forestus speaks of got the plague by only putting
his hand into an old trunk; or that the shaking an
old feather-bed, which had lain by seven years, raised
a plague at <i>Wratislau</i>, which destroyed five thousand
persons in twelve weeks, as related by Alexander Benedictus,
&amp;c.&mdash;Such things <i>may be true</i>, but, when
probability is shaken, reason always inclines to skepticism.”</p>

<p>Here our author most evidently contradicts himself;
for in the beginning of the paragraph he tells us that
the things related are <i>incredible</i>, and in the end of it, that
they <i>may be true</i>. The argument, if it may be so called,
is mere assertion. It is <i>incredible</i> that the smell of putrid
human blood in a vial should produce the dysentery.
Why should this be more incredible than that smelling
to a charged vial should ensure an electric shock to the
person who did so? This is entirely a question respecting
a matter of fact, not of speculation. The same is the
case with the rest. It is not more incredible that, if the
infection of the plague was in a trunk, a man should get
the plague by putting his hand in it, than that he should
be burnt if he put his hand into a trunk full of hot ashes.
Before the Doctor decided in such a positive manner,
he ought to have proved that no infection could be
contained in a trunk; but this, though the very point
in question, he takes for granted, first telling us that the
contrary is incredible, and then that it may be true!</p>

<p>3. “We observe in camps and hospitals, that those
people <i>whose dirty employments</i> subject them in a particular
manner to a <i>depravation of their habits</i>, seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
escape the present epidemic; and this gives rise to the
vulgar expression, and very incorrect notion, of <i>catching</i>
the disease. And we observe that others from the
slightest deviation from regularity lose the power by
which the body resists diseases, and they are also attacked.
But these attacks are not to be attributed to
infection: for those people who keep the vital and
animal powers in uniform confederacy, by temperance
and calmness of mind (for fear, by lowering the vital
energy, subjects the body to disease) nourishing diet,
proper clothing and cleanliness, and keeping a free and
regular passage for all excretions, are proof against the
assaults of foul and pestilential air. Such people seldom
suffer even by the plague itself: while all around
them perish.”</p>

<p>The first sentence of the above paragraph is so obscurely
worded, that it is difficult to know the author’s
meaning. I know not of any lawful employment so <i>dirty</i>
that it necessarily subjects the person who practises it to
a <i>depravation of habit</i>. The next ascribes every thing
to intemperance and fear; from which, it seems, we are
to infer that none but drunkards, cowards, and dirty,
naked ragamuffins, are ever seized with epidemic diseases.
But of this we are able to bring a direct disproof. I suppose
Dr. Mosely will not say that the celebrated Prince
Eugene of Savoy was either a coward or a drunkard;
that he had a <i>dirty employment</i>, wanted proper food or
clothes, or was deficient in personal cleanliness; yet,
when in the marshy parts of Hungary, he was in danger
of death from an epidemic dysentery, notwithstanding
that he was so careful in respect of diet, that he had
pure water brought him every day, probably from a
considerable distance. How came he to be affected by
the distemper under such circumstances, while Count
Boneval, though as an inferior officer he probably enjoyed
fewer advantages, remained free from it, taking only
a small quantity of Peruvian bark daily? It is uncertain
whether the bark did really preserve him or not; but
the case of Prince Eugene plainly shows that sobriety,
temperance, valour and cleanliness are not sufficient to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
ward off an epidemic disease, if people come in the way
of infection.</p>

<p>4. “It should follow, if contagion were supported by
infected bodies, that no person should ever escape
infection (as at Oxford assizes in <span class="nowrap">1577<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span>) who was
within the sphere of its action; and that those who
were entirely secluded from it, and free from all contiguity
to infected people, or substances, as the collegers
were in the town of Cambridge, when the plague
was last in England, should be exempt from it.</p>

<p>“But, in opposition to this, <i>Rhazes</i> lived 120 years,
an often practised in plagues. <i>Hodges</i> remained in
town, and attended the sick, during the great plague
in 1665. <i>Kaye</i> was in the midst of practice in the
sweating sickness in 1551, without any inconveniency.
<i>Procopius</i> informs us, that during a terrible plague at
Constantinople, in 543, which almost destroyed the
whole city, no physician nor other person got the
plague by attending, dressing or touching the sick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Yet most of the Capuchins, the Jesuits, the Recollets,
the Observantines, the Barefooted Carmelites, the
Reformed Augustines, all the Grand Carmelites, the
Grand Trinitarians, the Reformed Trinitarians, the
Monks of Loretto, of Mercy, the Dominicans, and
Grand Augustines, who kept themselves secluded in
their several convents, and took every precaution to
avoid the plague, while it raged at Marseilles, perished
by it.</p>

<p>“There are no epidemical nor contagious diseases
that attack every person who breathes the same air,
or that is in contact with the infection, else whole
regions would be depopulated. The habit must be
graduated, or adapted, for the reception of a disease.
In some constitutions of body the access is easy, in
some difficult, in others impossible. <i>But where the
revelation of this mystery is to be found, none can tell.</i>”</p>

<p>In this, which our author seems to have designed as
his <i>grand argument</i>, it is plain that the deficiency is as
great as in any of the rest. If we suppose the plague, or
any other epidemic disease, to arise from some general
cause, let that cause be <i>contagion</i> or any thing else, it
ought to operate upon all who come within its sphere of
action, as Dr. Mosely observes of <i>infection</i>. If experience
shows that it does not, the argument will hold equally
against a constitution of the atmosphere, putrid effluvia,
heat, cold, or any thing else; and in fact the Doctor
fairly gives up the point at last, by resolving the whole
into an <i>unrevealed</i> mystery. With regard to what he
says about the plague at Marseilles getting into the convents,
of which he presents us with such a catalogue, it is
impossible to know what precautions were used, and we
are assured that in Turky it is thought necessary for the
Europeans not only to guard against a communication
with their own species, but some of the brute creation
also. Cats particularly are dreaded so much, that a
general massacre of them commences among those who
use precautions, the favourites of that species must be
sent to a distance, and M. Volney mentions two merchants
who had shut up their houses, and yet had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
plague imported by a cat. In short, considering that
infection is supposed to be altogether invisible and imperceptible,
it is impossible to say how it may be conveyed,
or to what extent it may occasionally act when once
brought into a country. Dr. Fordyce is of opinion that
the distance at which infection may act depends on the
disposition of the air at the time; and he observes, that
a difference in this respect is observable in the odoriferous
effluvia of vegetables. “If the air be loaded with moisture,
they reach to a much greater distance. Vapour
arising from a field of beans, for instance, or a putrid
ditch, is sensible to the nostrils at a greater distance
if the air is moist.” He observes indeed that this
has never been verified with regard to infection; but as
it is evidently the case with putrid effluvia, which very
often accompany infection, we may reasonably conclude
that it is the case with the latter also.</p>

<p>Let us next take a view of what is advanced by the
authors of The Science of Life upon this subject.
Mr. McLean, who puts his name to this part, informs us
of his conviction “that no general disease, which affects
a person more than once during life, can ever be communicated
by contagion;” and he defines contagion
“a specific matter, generated in a person affected with
disease, and capable of communicating that particular
disease, with or without contact, to another.” It
would here be no improper question, by what means he
comes to know that a contagious disease can affect a
person only <i>once</i>. But even this question is unnecessary.
Dr. Guthrie gives an account of a gentleman who
had the courage to inoculate himself for the plague, in
consequence of which he had the disease with the concomitant
symptoms of buboes, &amp;c. Here then we see
the plague communicated by “a specific matter generated
in a person affected” with the same disease, i. e.
by <i>contagion</i>, according to Mr. McLean’s own definition.
The dispute therefore might stop, as this fact
seems to be decisive on the subject; but as he has at
great length insisted upon the argument last quoted from
Dr. Mosely, it seems necessary to follow him a little farther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>“If a person (says our author) be affected with any
disease, it will necessarily be communicated to every
other person who comes within the infectious distance,
and <i>is not at the same time labouring under some disease
higher in degree</i>.” This proceeds upon a supposition
that his theory is absolutely perfect and infallible; which,
however plain it may appear to himself, will not probably
be admitted by others without some proof. Indeed
he himself afterwards adduces some facts which decisively
overthrow it. “A child (says he) here and there is
exempted from small-pox, even though exposed to
its contagion.” How comes this to pass? The disease,
we are told, is contagious, the child is exposed to the contagion,
and yet is not affected. In <i>all</i> such cases it would
be ridiculous to suppose the subjects labouring under a
disease higher in degree than the contagion could produce.
In numbers of instances of this kind the children
were evidently in good health, and yet would perhaps be
seized at an after period when no more exposed to contagion
than they had been at first.</p>

<p>“Small-pox, measles, and other general diseases, which
occur only once during life, never disappear, until <i>the
whole</i> of those who have been within the infectious
distance, and were not at the time labouring under
some disease higher in degree, have received the infection.
As these diseases are <i>very mild</i>, children sometimes
resist the power of contagion from the superior
force of some other diseases, although they may be so
slight as to escape <i>common</i> observation.”</p>

<p>In this paragraph we have the favourite maxim of our
author repeated, <i>twice</i> indeed, without a single fact to
support it. Instead of this we find hypothesis heaped
upon hypothesis, as the giants are said to have heaped
mountains upon one another in order to get up to heaven.
He first supposes that the infection of the small-pox
seizes on <i>the whole</i> of those on whom it falls. The
exceptions to this maxim he explains by another <i>supposition</i>,
viz. that the contagion of the small-pox is counteracted
by another disease. The second hypothesis is
supported by a third, and that a very extraordinary one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
that the small-pox (a disease which has destroyed innumerable
multitudes) is <i>very mild</i>; and this third by a
fourth, that the diseases which counteracted the contagion
were so slight as to escape <i>common</i> observation. It
was incumbent on Mr. McLean to have pointed out
some of those diseases, and to have informed us how they
came to counteract this contagion. But it is needless to
argue with one who writes so extravagantly. Far from
the mode of reasoning followed by Dr. Fordyce, who
decided from the majority of facts, our author determines
every thing by his own preconceived opinions.
“That the power which occasioned disease at the Oxford
assizes (says he) was not contagious matter, is
proved by its producing diarrhœa in some, while it
produced fevers in others.” But, if it was not contagious
matter, what kind of matter was it? Or how
comes our author to know that those who were affected
by the diarrhœa were not likewise affected by fever?
How many fevers are attended by diarrhœa, or how many
cease when diarrhœa comes on! It would have been
equally conclusive to say that the matter was not contagious,
because some died and some recovered.</p>

<p>I shall only take notice of one assertion more, it being
both tedious and unnecessary to follow him through the
whole. “From <i>every</i> record of epidemic and pestilential
diseases, it would appear, that they have their stated
periods of recurrence; that these periods are such
months as are most remarkable for vicissitudes of the
atmosphere; that they become general only in those
years in which these vicissitudes are extreme; that
they do not occur in seasons when the heats or colds,
however intense, are equable; nor in years when the
state of the atmosphere is tempered throughout; and
that they uniformly cease with the establishment of
an equable state of the atmosphere, whether the weather
be cold or hot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In Aleppo, according to Dr.
Russel, the Europeans regularly shut themselves up in
their houses <i>every year</i>, at some period between April
and July; and the rich natives begin to adopt the
same plan, &amp;c.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From this fact it appears, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
the plague occurs at Aleppo, in a state more or less
mild, almost annually, and <i>that it commences and ceases
at certain known periods</i>. But it has been remarked
that, in its most severe state, this disease recurs only at
periods of ten years, or <i>thereabouts</i>: a regularity which
cannot, upon any known principle, be attributed to a
power of such casual application as contagious matter.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of this paragraph our author makes
a bold appeal to <i>every</i> record of epidemic and pestilential
disorders; but here we may ask, Has he consulted
<i>every</i> record of these disorders? That he has not, we may
readily believe; but even those which are hinted at seem
either to have been very inaccurately consulted, or wilfully
misrepresented. To evince this I subjoin the following
abstract of what Dr. Alexander Russel says of
the plague in general, with the annotations of his brother,
Dr. Patrick, taken from Russel’s Natural History
of Aleppo.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Aleppo suppose that the plague
visits them once in ten years, and that it is always imported;
and the most severe plagues are thought by
some to come from Damascus, while others contend
that they come from the northward. Dr. Alexander
Russel thinks this popular opinion of the return of the
plague not altogether unfounded; and he thinks it also
probable that it never invades Aleppo without having
previously attacked either Damascus or Khillis, Aintab,
Marash or Uufa. He thinks that its appearance always
is in one of the maritime towns of Syria; if in Sidon,
Byroot or Tripoli, Damascus is commonly the channel
by which it reaches Aleppo; but, if it shows itself first
at Scanderoon or Byass, its approach is by the way of
Khillis or Aintab.</p>

<p>On this Dr. Patrick Russel observes, that the account
of Aleppo being visited only once in ten or twelve years
is confirmed by a letter from an English gentleman, in
1719, who had resided there for 30 years. The dates
of the plagues which Dr. Patrick had procured were,
1719, 1729 and 1733. Another began in 1742, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
terminated in 1744; from which time there was no
return till 1757 or 1758, when it continued at Aleppo
till 1762, and did not entirely quit the country till 1764.
The plague of 1719 was said to come from the northward,
but this appeared to want confirmation; but all
accounts agree that it raged at Tripoli, Sidon, &amp;c. two
months before it appeared in Aleppo. Egypt was ravaged
by the plague in 1728, as was also Byass and the
neighbouring parts in the same summer; and next year
it appeared at Aleppo. In 1732 it raged at Sidon, Tripoli
and Damascus; next year it seized Aleppo.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexander goes on to inform us, that the disease
never spreads much in winter. It advances with the
spring, comes to its height in June, declines in July,
and terminates in August. “None (he says) are ever
seized with in September and October, not even in the
plague of 1742, which returned three years successively;”
but Dr. Patrick says that this was not confirmed by his
experience in 1760, though he owns that the distemper
declines remarkably at that period; and the natives are
greatly inclined to have it believed that the distemper
has totally ceased, and to deceive the Europeans in
this respect. The times at which the Europeans shut
up and come out of their confinement show only the
increase or decrease of the disease, but not its beginning
or ending. The plague of 1719 made terrible havoc.
Europeans then shut up about the middle of March,
and kept confined till the middle of July. In 1729
they did not shut up till the middle of May, and were
not confined above a month, the number of sick being
small. In 1733 they were confined from the middle of
March to the middle of July, but the distemper was
less violent than in 1719. In 1742 the time of confinement
much as in 1729. In 1743 shut up April 11,
and opened the middle of July. The plague violent,
but less so than in 1733. In 1744 few shut up, the
number of sick being inconsiderable. In 1760 they
shut up on the 30th of June, and continued about a
month. In 1761 shut up May 28, rode out Aug. 1,
and opened completely the 10th of that month. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
1762 they were confined from the last week in May to
the first of August. From 1762 to 1787, a larger period
than usual, the city was free from the plague. In
1787 it broke out among the Jews in the month of
April, increased in May, raged violently in June, and
terminated in July.</p>

<p>From these accounts it appears, as Dr. Alexander
Russel informs us, that the plague of one year differs
remarkably from that of another; but he says, that,
at Aleppo, it is never attended with such scenes of
horror as have been known in European countries; for
which Dr. Patrick assigns the following reasons: 1. The
markets are constantly supplied with provisions. 2. The
dread of the contagion is much less. 3. The sick are less
liable to be deserted by their attendants (but this, according
to his own observation, is not always the case) and
4. The regular, speedy interment of the dead prevents a
spectacle far from uncommon in the European plagues,
and which of all others is the most shocking to humanity.</p>

<p>“Extreme heat (says Dr. Alexander) seems to check
the progress of the distemper. July is a hotter month
than June, and the season wherein the plague ceases
at Aleppo is that in which the heats are most excessive.”
His experience did not confirm a popular
opinion at Aleppo, and which has likewise been adopted
by many medical writers, that the moon has any influence
on the distemper. To have had the distemper
once does not secure a person against future attacks.
Numbers of people who were alive when he left Aleppo
had it twice or oftener; and he had instances of some
being infected thrice in one season. Dr. Patrick Russel
has observations to the same purpose.</p>

<p>From this it appears, that the popular opinion at Aleppo,
which Mr. McLean wishes to establish as a certainty,
is by no means so well founded that we can build any
theory upon it. The misfortune is, that, wherever a
theory is built upon any thing said to be constant and
invariable, a single failure overturns the whole. Now,
in the dates of plagues above mentioned, the variations
are so great that it is impossible to draw any certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
conclusion from them. In the first three instances of
1719, 1729 and 1733 there is indeed a coincidence of
the first two, but the last falls short by no less than <i>six</i>
years. What then does Mr. McLean mean by his “ten
years, or <i>thereabouts</i>?” Can <i>thereabouts</i> imply a difference
of more than half? The English gentleman’s testimony
who resided 30 years in that country could extend
no further than to three plagues, and even these are not
mentioned. The fourth instance in 1742 is deficient in
one year; the fifth in 1757 or 1758 exceeds by three or
four years, and the sixth from 1762 to 1787 by no less
than fifteen years.</p>

<p>An anonymous writer in a Scots periodical publication
entitled “The Bee,” has partly adopted the above
opinion, but adds others for which he has not thought
proper to adduce any authority. “It visits <i>most parts of
Asia</i> once in ten or twelve years, and carries off an
eighth or tenth of the inhabitants. There have been
plagues which have carried off one fourth of the inhabitants.
The farther east you go, the less frequent it
is&mdash;every 20th, 40th, and, even at Bassorah, every
90th year; but then this scourge is most dreadful.
The last plague at Bassorah, which had not visited the
city for 96 years, carried of more than nine tenths of
the inhabitants.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> It is astonishing that people will
write in such a manner as to subject themselves to endless
criticism on account of their inconsistency. The plague,
this writer says, visits <i>most parts</i> of Asia once every ten
or twelve years, and yet it goes no farther east than Bassorah;
a space scarce equivalent to the twentieth part of
Asia! Even in this small space, it varies from ten or
twelve, to twenty, forty, or even ninety years; and, to
complete the whole, instead of giving any instance of the
periodical return of the plague at an interval of <i>ninety</i>
years, we have one of its disappearance for <i>ninety-six</i>
years!</p>

<p>From all this it is evident, that no dependence can be
placed on such vague accounts with regard to the periodical
returns of the plague. Even the time of shutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
up the houses in Aleppo is not accurately related, for,
from the above abstract it is plain, that they are sometimes
shut up in March; while Mr. McLean would
have us to believe that it is always between April and
July. It is needless to wade through a jumble of unsupported
assertions, which, being backed by no evidence,
fall to the ground of themselves. “I will <i>venture to assert</i>
(says he) that no person in perfect health ever
was or <i>can be</i> exposed to the power of contagion, without
receiving the specific disease which that contagion
produces; excepting in small-pox, measles, &amp;c.
when the person has previously had the disease.”&mdash;How
comes he to know all this? Or, though our author
ventures to assert, must we of necessity <i>venture to
believe</i>? When he ascribes the origin of epidemics, and
the plague itself, to the vicissitudes of the atmosphere,
not a single fact is adduced in support of his hypothesis.
One very strange proof indeed he brings from Dr. Rush,
viz. that the latter had been informed by a gentleman
who resided in tropical countries, that, in the month of
July, several weeks before the yellow fever became general,
he had observed a peculiar and universal sallowness
of complexion in the countenances of the people of Philadelphia,
such as he had seen in those of the more
southern countries before the appearance of bilious fevers
in them. Surely it is a very strange mode of argument
to tell us of the colour of people’s countenances instead
of the states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere, which we
are made to believe were the causes of that change.
Another quotation is made from the same author in
which a warm, dry, stagnating air is <i>conjectured</i> to have
been the cause of <i>diseases</i>; but he does not even quote
Dr. Rush saying that it was the cause of yellow fever,
much less of all epidemic diseases. Besides, to say that
any thing is occasioned by a <i>state</i>, or <i>vicissitude</i> of the atmosphere,
is such a vague mode of expression, that it
must either mean nothing, or be contradictory to itself.
A <i>state</i> of the atmosphere we must suppose to mean that
it continues for some time either to be wet or dry; a <i>vicissitude</i>,
when it changes from one to the other. If an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
epidemic then is produced by a <i>state</i>, it cannot also be
produced by a <i>vicissitude</i>, of the atmosphere: or, if some
epidemics are produced by states, and others by vicissitudes,
we ought to be informed which produce one kind,
and which another. But throughout the whole of this
dissertation we have neither distinctness nor regularity,
nor indeed any thing but assertion, supported only by an
imaginary theory.</p>

<p>Dismissing at length therefore these conjectural theories,
let us endeavour to deduce from certain and undoubted
facts the connexion between the state of the
body, and the operations upon it of other causes, invisible
indeed to our eyes, but discoverable by our rational
faculties, and in some measure capable of being made
the objects of our senses also.</p>

<p>1. From the account given of the structure of the
human body, it undeniably follows, and has already been
observed, that all parts of it are so connected together,
that none can suffer any very grievous injury without affecting
all the rest.</p>

<p>2. The life of man depends immediately on the air.
From this element the <i>blood</i> receives heat and a vital
spirit diffusing itself from the blood along the nerves,
and thence expended in the operations of life and sensation.</p>

<p>3. From undoubted <span class="nowrap">experiments<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> it appears, that
this vital spirit possesses in a great degree the properties
of electricity, insomuch that many suppose them to be
the same. This is indeed denied by the celebrated
anatomist, Dr. Monro, but he allows that the nervous
fluid is similar to electricity, and it is certain that the
electrical fluid can affect it in such a manner that we
may reasonably believe them to be the same.</p>

<p>4. The air acts upon the blood by the <i>latent</i> heat it
contains. The air itself is composed of something
volatilised by heat. In some cases this is evidently a
terrestrial substance, as in that of inflammable air, or
hydrogen, which is formed of charcoal volatilised by
heat, with the addition of a little water. In the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
oxygen, or dephlogisticated air, the combination seems
to be the matter of heat (which I shall hereafter distinguish
by the name of the <i>ethereal fluid</i>) with water deprived
of its carbonic principle. This coincides with
the opinion of Dr. Priestley, who says that the basis of
dephlogisticated air seems to be <i>dephlogisticated water</i>.
But, let the basis be what it will, the ethereal fluid which
volatilises it is the <i>agent</i>; the basis is entirely <i>passive</i>, and
only modifies or restrains the action of the other fluid,
so that it does not exert itself except in particular cases.
Fixed air, or carbonic acid, is composed of the base of
oxygen united with a certain portion of carbon, and the
whole volatilised by the ethereal fluid. Phlogisticated
air, azote, or septon, according to Dr. Priestley, consists
of the basis of dephlogisticated air along with a certain
proportion of carbon different from that which produces
fixed air, volatilised by the same agent<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> and so we
may determine concerning every other species of air.</p>

<p>5. In certain cases the ethereal fluid quits those substances
with which it is united: the air is then decomposed,
the substance into which the other fluid enters is
heated, or rendered more fluid than before (perhaps
both) while the basis either unites itself to the moisture
of the lungs, or is thrown out by the breath. Whether
in any case the basis can pervade the membranes, and
thus mix itself with the blood, notwithstanding the
positive assertions of Dr. Girtanner and others, is very
doubtful, and does not admit of any positive proof.</p>

<p>6. The blood, being a <i>fluid</i>, must be subject to the
same laws with other fluids. A certain quantity of
<i>latent</i> heat must be contained in it, in order to give the
degree of fluidity naturally belonging to it. If this
quantity be augmented, the fluidity will be augmented,
and the blood will become thinner; if it be diminished,
the contrary will take place; and if we suppose a great
proportion of this latent heat to be abstracted, it is not
unreasonable to suppose that something like a congelation
may take place, and the blood be changed into a solid
substance of such a nature as cannot any more be made
to resume its former qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>7. By augmenting the sensible heat, the blood is affected
in the same manner as any other fluid; it suffers
expansion, by which the vessels are dilated in proportion,
and, if this expansion and dilation be carried to a certain
length, a rupture of many of the small vessels, and
apoplexy, or some other grievous disease, may ensue.</p>

<p>8. By breathing certain kinds of air, the fluidity, heat
and expansion of the blood, and of consequence the dilation
of the blood-vessels, are affected. Thus, when a
person breathes a quantity of the fume of charcoal,
containing much fixed air, he feels himself affected with
pain and a sensation of fulness in his head; he becomes
sleepy, and, if the quantity be sufficiently great, he falls
into an apoplexy, and dies. From dissections it appears
that such as die in this manner have the capillary vessels
greatly distended, and even ruptured; the heat of the
body is vastly augmented, and even continues some time
after death. Hence it is evident, that, by breathing
this kind of air, too much <i>sensible</i> heat is conveyed to
the blood. In like manner when we breathe the steam of
water, if any quantity of that steam be condensed in the
lungs, the whole quantity of latent heat contained in
that steam discharges itself upon the lungs, and increases
the sensible heat of the body; and from this we may
learn why on some occasions our sensations should so ill
correspond with the thermometer, and why a warm air
almost saturated with moisture should always appear
much hotter than a dry one, though the thermometer
stand at an equal height in both. Oxygen air seems
to convey to the blood a much larger quantity of
what we have called <i>vital spirit</i>, than any other kind.
Whether this vital spirit be the same with the latent
heat of the blood, we know not; but, as this kind of
air is evidently capable of supplying the blood both with
latent and sensible heat, it seems most probable, that,
by breathing a considerable proportion of it, both these
kinds of heat, as well as the vital spirit itself, will be
augmented. In this case, wherever the air naturally
contains a larger quantity of oxygen than usual, the
blood ought to be mere fluid, as well as warmer, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
usual, provided there be no evident cause why it should
be otherwise. Accordingly in warm climates it is always
found that the blood is thinner and more fluid
than in such as are colder; but at the same time the
temperature of the body is colder than in other countries.
Zimmerman tells us, that, “at Curassau, Europeans
gradually lose their fresh colour and vivacity:
their natural heat even becomes three or four degrees
less than it was at their arrival.” The reason of this
last, however, is evidently the excessive perspiration,
which is more than sufficient to carry off the superabundant
quantity of sensible heat thrown into the body,
either by the rays of the sun, or by the superior quantity
of oxygen naturally existing in the atmosphere; for it
is now found, contrary to the opinions hitherto received,
that in the warmer climates the atmosphere contains a
larger proportion of oxygen than in the more temperate<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span></p>

<p>From this discovery it appears, that, whatever may be
the cause of the frequency and violence of epidemics in
warm climates, it <i>is not</i> the want of oxygen. Nay, we
should rather be tempted to think that they were produced
by too great an abundance of it; and this the more
especially when we know that animals confined in oxygen
air are supposed to die of a burning fever; and it is likewise
known that this kind of air is prejudicial to consumptive
people, and even brings on the disease on those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
who had it not before. From the experiments mentioned
in the note, it seems probable that there are but few
even of swampy places in hot climates, where oxygen
does not predominate; and in these the heat thrown into
the blood must still be augmented by that produced
from the quantity of vapour decomposed or condensed
in the lungs, which, as the condensation depends upon
unknown circumstances, can never be foreseen, or ever
prevented, but by a removal from the place.</p>

<p>With regard to other kinds of air, such as inflammable,
phlogisticated air, &amp;c. experiments are yet wanting
to determine their effects upon people who breathe them
habitually. The proportion in which they occasionally
exist in the atmosphere on particular occasions has not
been ascertained, and from the experiment made by Dr.
Priestley with offensive air taken from a manufactory,
as well as from Dr. Chisholm just mentioned, the probability
is, that, even in the most offensive places, the proportion
of azote is by no means so great to the oxygen
that we could suppose the excess capable of producing a
disorder of any consequence, much less a violent epidemic.
Fixed air is always produced in the putrefactive
process, and from its quality above mentioned of rarefying
and heating the blood, might reasonably be supposed
to have some share in producing epidemics, were it not
that this kind of air is so readily absorbed by water, as
well as a number of other substances, that, except at the
very moment of emission, we can scarce suppose it to
have any considerable effect.</p>

<p>Mr. Watt in a letter to Dr. Beddoes gives an account
of a kind of air, seemingly more noxious than any yet
discovered, which he produced by distillation from flesh
and from wool. The effects upon himself were so disagreeable
that he determined to make no more such experiments,
lest he should to his own hurt discover a
mode of producing some grievous disease. But we cannot,
from an artificial air of this kind, argue to a natural
one; as the one produced by Mr. Watt was totally different
from any species of air naturally known. All that
we can say is, that, as far as we can trace the connexion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
between our bodies and the different kinds of air which
may be breathed, the latter act chiefly by the heat they
contain, and which they impart to the body in various
proportions; by which means the latent or sensible heat
of the blood, and consequently of the whole body, may
be occasionally augmented or diminished. Thus the
body may be considerably altered in its constitution,
and rendered more liable to diseases than it was before;
but still it is found that diseases continue to appear at
uncertain intervals, though all the causes we are able to
discover, or at least all that are constantly evident to our
senses, continue to operate without intermission. Though
the obvious qualities of air and climate therefore may
<i>predispose</i> to an epidemic, we cannot affirm any thing
farther: the direct <i>cause</i> is always different, and hath
hitherto so much eluded our researches, that we can have
little hope of discovering it, except by reasoning from
facts less obscure.</p>

<p>8. In all the operations of nature which we have access
to investigate, the action of electricity is so much
concerned, that we can scarce suppose it to be wanting
in any of them. That it is concerned in preserving
the health of the human body is likewise certain,
if it be the fluid which acts in the nerves, as most probably
it is. But whatever preserves health will also
bring on disease, if it be applied to that purpose; and
we have already seen that this fluid is capable of bringing
on the most dreadful symptoms, viz. mortification
in its highest stage, fever, convulsions, bilious discharges,
lethargy, &amp;c. If it be capable of producing all these,
can we say that it is not capable of producing those of
an inferior kind, or of varying diseases and symptoms
without end, according to the immense diversity of its
action? It may be said that this disease was occasioned
by a violent stroke of electricity, similar to lightning;
but how many people have declared, that, in the
beginning of some violent epidemics, they have felt a
sudden stroke at the time of seizure! Dr. Hodges
mentions this in the plague of 1665 at London, but
treats the accounts as effects of a distempered imagination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Procopius relates the same of the plague in his
time, viz. that many of the diseased felt a stroke. It
is true that they said such strokes were given by spirits
in human shape, in which we know they must have
been deceived; but, though they were mistaken in
supposing that they had been struck by a spirit, it does
not from thence follow that they felt no stroke at all.
The people mentioned by Dr. Hodges did not say that
they were struck by a <i>spirit</i>, yet he treats their accounts
with as great contempt as though they had. Where
people have no interest in deceiving, we ought certainly
to look with a favourable eye upon their testimony; for,
even although some part of it should be incredible, we
have still reason to believe that there is some foundation
for what they say. Thus, the poor sailor, so much frightened
at the sight of a large bat in New Holland, was
certainly mistaken in saying that he had seen the devil;
he was even mistaken in saying that he had <i>horns</i><span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> but
from all this it would have been doing him great injustice
to say that he had seen nothing. In like manner, when
numbers of people in Procopius’s time said that they
were struck by spirits, when we find others in Dr. Hodges’s
time saying that they were struck by some invisible
agent, when we know that electricity <i>can</i> strike in an
invisible manner, it certainly is more reasonable to conclude
that violent diseases sometimes do begin by an electric
stroke, than that <i>all</i> who said they were struck in
this manner were madmen or liars.</p>

<p>It may now again be asked, if the plague, or violent
epidemics, be produced by electric strokes, why are they
not much more frequently felt, or by what are those
milder diseases produced which are not accompanied by
any sensible stroke? Here we can be at no loss to say,
that whatever produces the highest disease, may also produce
the lowest. But, besides this argument, we have
positive evidence that commotions in the electric fluid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
will not only produce sickness, but very extraordinary
and seemingly miraculous effects upon inanimate bodies.
It has frequently been remarked that people are sick
during the time of earthquakes, when the electric matter
is in violent agitation. This has been accounted
for from the motion of the earth, as the motion of a
ship produces sea-sickness. But Dr. Hillary mentions
a slight earthquake in Barbadoes where people were affected
with sickness and vomiting for <i>some hours</i> after
the phenomenon had ceased altogether; which undoubtedly
shows, that a certain state of this fluid will disorder
the human body, independent of every other circumstance,
either of the heat or cold of the atmosphere, or
the oxygen, hydrogen or azote contained in it. Again,
we find that a certain state of the electric matter is not
only capable of producing very extraordinary effects by
itself, but also of communicating a power to the human
body to do the same. A good number of years ago, a
powder-mill near London was blown up. The explosion,
as might be expected, was violent and tremendous;
but the most remarkable circumstance was, that
the electric matter, for a great way round, was thrown
into unusual, though invisible, commotions, which discovered
themselves by the rattling and breaking of china
dishes though sitting apparently undisturbed upon
their shelves. This phenomenon did not suddenly cease,
and, during the time of it, some people appeared to be
infected by an electric <i>contagion</i>; the power of breaking
china seemed to reside in their bodies, so that if they approached
or touched this kind of ware, it would instantly
fly to pieces. Accounts of this extraordinary circumstance
were published in many of the periodical works
of the time, particularly in Dodsley’s Annual Register;
and the fact seems to be established beyond controversy.
It proves that what has been advanced by Dr. Priestley
concerning electrical operations, on a small scale, holds
good also on a large one, viz. that the fluid, when once
set in motion, is not easily quieted. It establishes the
fact, also, that by great explosions of gun-powder the
electric matter is violently agitated; and the consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
of these agitations we cannot know. It may be
said, indeed, that in the operations of nature the electric
matter is often violently moved without any sickness taking
place; neither in fact did any ensue at the time the
powder-mill in question was blown up. But it must be
remembered, that, in the ordinary course of nature, if the
electric matter is moved, a receptacle is also provided
for it. In a thunder-storm, where immense discharges
of electricity are made from one cloud, there is another
cloud of an electricity opposite to the former ready to
receive them, or if not, the earth itself is frequently struck.
In eruptions of volcanoes, the smoke receives the electricity
discharged, and becomes charged with lightning of
a more dangerous kind than that of ordinary thunderstorms;
and Sir William Hamilton relates, that in the
great eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, lightning of this
kind proceeded from the smoke for no less a space than
<i>seventeen</i> days. But in artificial commotions of this fluid,
where nature has not provided any receptacle, the
phenomena must be quite different; and though we
may with safety to ourselves interfere with the operations
of fire and electricity to a certain degree, yet we may at
last rouse these terrible elements into such action as will
prove fatal to great numbers. Hence possibly may arise
in part some of those sicknesses which take place after
battles, in violent sieges, &amp;c. An instance of this is
said to have happened at Valenciennes, when last besieged
by the Duke of York. A disease prevailed chiefly
among women, children, and persons of a weak constitution;
great numbers of whom died so suddenly that
it was at first thought to be a plague, until it was found
not to be infectious. The blood was found greatly dissolved,
and the physicians ascribed it to the monstrous
bombardment and cannonading which took place during
the siege. Such was the account published in some of
the newspapers of the time, and from the subsequent
considerations it will not seem improbable that such
things may take place.</p>

<p>From the experiments of Mr. Bennet (an English gentleman
who has made several discoveries in electricity)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
it appears, that we can neither brush a piece of chalk,
open or shut a book, or do several of the most trifling
actions, without agitating this subtile fluid in a perceptible
manner. It is well known that in some cases we
cannot stroke a cat’s back without making the electric
matter visible, and in some positions, by putting our
fingers near the ears of the animal, very pungent sparks
will be received. If then we can neither open or shut a
book, if we cannot stroke a cat’s back, or approach a
finger to her ear, without agitating the electric fluid, is
it reasonably to think we could burn a book, or kill a
cat, without doing the same? Certainly it is not. If
we cannot burn a book or kill a cat without affecting
this fluid, it cannot be supposed that we can burn a
house or kill a man without producing a still greater
commotion; and in proportion to the extent of our devastations,
and the multitude of our massacres, the invisible
agitation of this element must become still greater
and greater. In all these transactions it must be remembered
that the fluid is forced out of its natural mode of
action; for electric matter is made for the preservation, not
the destruction, of life: but if, by long continued and extensive
application of its power to a contrary purpose, we
in some measure pervert its action, no wonder that we
then feel the consequences of our own proceedings by its
partly turning its power against the human race altogether.</p>

<p>Again, the human body is not made for the habitation
of an infernal spirit, but for one of a quite different
character. The boisterous passions of fury, discord and
hatred ought never to disturb the mind, which is made
for the habitation of endless peace and joy. The tumultuous
passions are enemies to health; and this is so well
known to physicians that they are very careful to prevent
their patients from being any way ruffled or disturbed by
violent passions. It is true these passions act upon the
rational soul, which we may suppose to be distinct from
that merely animal spirit, probably no other than the
electric fluid, which runs along the nerves; but experience
shows that each of these can act upon the other; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
disorder in the body, particularly in the nervous system,
will sometimes disturb the rational soul in such a manner
as almost entirely to deprive it of all its faculties;
while on the other hand a violent commotion in the
rational soul may at once extinguish all the powers of
life, as has already been shown from Zimmerman. Now,
let any one consider what must be the sensations of those
who engage in war. Whatever pity or humanity may
be pretended, it is evident that in the day of battle all
these sensations must give way to horror and fury on the
part of the conquerors, and terror and dismay on that
of the vanquished. That these passions never do entirely
subside, is evident from the treatment of conquered
countries and conquered people. When Jenghiz Khan
beheaded his prisoners by hundreds of thousands, when
Tamerlane pounded them in mortars, when Khouli Khan
caused those who offended him to be carried from place to
place, and a piece of flesh to be cut from their bodies at
each stage, what must have been the sensations of these
miscreants, and those whom they employed in such horrid
scenes? On the other hand, what must be the sensations
of those who see their dearest relations torn from them
and slaughtered or treated even worse than if they were;
themselves driven from their peaceable abodes to wander
like beasts, while their cruel enemies exult in the miseries
they have brought upon them, and glory in doing
all the mischief they can, and spreading devastation as
wide as possible? Thus, every passion, inimical to health,
must, on both sides, be carried to its utmost height; and
if these horrid scenes overspread a great part of the earth,
for hundreds of years together, is it any wonder that
plagues should ensue? If man, forgetting the dignity of
his nature, converts the habitation assigned him by his
Maker into a kind of hell, and himself into a devil, can
we wonder that, in such circumstances, the spirit of life,
originally appointed for his use, should become to such a
being the spirit of death? Dr. Moseley seems to speak
slightly of Helmont for assigning <i>moral</i> causes to fever;
but if we consider the matter attentively it will certainly
be found that the moral conduct of the human race in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
general has more connexion with the diseases which befal
them, than we are perhaps willing to believe.</p>

<p>Most authors speak of some hidden, unknown and
unsearchable power in the atmosphere as the occasion
of plagues and other epidemics; and, from what has
been already laid down, it seems by no means improbable
that this hidden power resides in the electric part of
it. But we know that electricity proceeds from the
earth, as well as from the air; so that in some countries
the evaporation of electric matter from the earth may
affect the health of the inhabitants, as well as the constitution
of the atmosphere. Hence some spots may be
naturally unhealthy, and incurably so, independent of
either the perceptible or imperceptible properties of the
air; their healthiness may occasionally increase or decrease
by means entirely beyond the reach of our investigation.
Here then our inquiries must stop. We may
indeed make a general conjecture that such differences
are produced by the action of the electric matter; but,
unless this action be pointed out, and some connexion
traced between the situation of the country and a particular
mode of action of the fluid, we may as well own
our ignorance at once.</p>

<p>9. From all that has been said, then, we may conclude,
that none of the obvious properties of the atmosphere,
or of any constituent part of it, or of any variation
in the proportion of its ingredients, can be accounted
the cause of epidemic diseases; that the hidden constitution
of the atmosphere may with probability be
attributed to the agency of the electric fluid, and that
by the action of this secret cause, along with the other
more obvious properties of the air, such as heat or cold,
moisture or dryness, &amp;c. the human body may be so
predisposed to diseases, that they will readily break forth;
and that the conduct of mankind themselves may
greatly contribute to this predisposition; the question
then is, supposing every thing to be thus laid, like a
train of gun-powder, what is the spark which first sets it
on fire. Does the disease arise spontaneously in the first
person affected by it, or does it come from without?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>In answer to this we must in the first place observe,
that the accounts of all plagues mentioned in profane
history trace their progress from one place to another;
whence the probability is, that at its origin the disease was
confined to a few, perhaps to a single person. In very few
cases, however, has it been possible to trace it to an individual;
and, even when this has been done, the unfortunate
individual is always said to come from some
other place. The instance quoted from Dr. Moore is
perhaps the only one upon record where the plague
arose spontaneously in any person separated from society;
and from a single instance little can be inferred.
In those terrible examples we have given of people being
burned to death without any accident from terrestrial
fuel, the agent seems almost certainly to have been
electricity. In the plague of Procopius, said not to have
been infectious, the strokes complained of by many patients
seem to indicate an action of the same fluid. The same
in the plague at London, which was infectious, and
likewise of others. But, in cases of plagues which are
not infectious, another question arises&mdash;By what means
do such diseases spread from place to place? for even
this dreadful pestilence of Procopius did not overspread
the earth at once, but is said to have begun at
Pelusium in Egypt. To this no answer can be given.
To suppose an omnipresent contagion in the atmosphere,
proceeding either from contagion or any thing else,
cannot be admitted; for upon this supposition the
whole world must have been infected at once. The
cause, whatever it was, plainly moved from one place to
another, or was successively generated in different places.
Recourse may be had to the precipitation of the contagious
matter of former plagues from the atmosphere; but
to account for this in succession will be found very difficult;
and the same difficulty will attend every other
solution which may be attempted. Mr. Gibbon indeed
censures Procopius for supposing it not to have been infectious;
and perhaps the spreading of the disease by
infection is the only way by which we can account, in
a satisfactory manner, for the way in which it diffused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
itself over the world, which was, by first infecting the
maritime places, and afterwards those which were more
inland; always visiting the second year those whom it
had spared the first.</p>

<p>10. Lastly, to form some idea of the nature of contagion,
or infection, as it is more properly called, we must
consider, that as the ethereal fluid, acting as heat, pervades
the human body, so doth it likewise under that
particular modification which we call electricity. Some
kinds of air, indeed most of those with which we are acquainted,
seem to act by augmenting or diminishing the
latent or the sensible heat of the body. Such, when taken
in moderate quantity, may produce slight diseases, as
head-ach, &amp;c. and, when taken very largely, may even
put an end to life at once, either by rarefaction of the
blood and rupture of the small vessels, as is the case with
fixed air, or by oppressing the lungs entirely with their
basis, which cannot be thrown out by the breath as in ordinary
respiration. Others may affect the electricity of
it, or what in this treatise has been called the <i>vital spirit</i>,
as well as the latent or sensible heat. The consequence
of this will be diseases of a more serious nature;
for upon this principle in all probability depend not only
the secretion and proper regulation of the nervous fluid,
but what has been called the <i>crafts</i>, or proper consistence
of the blood and other fluids. Hence it is possible
that such an instantaneous shock may be given to
the body, as will not only injure the organization in an
irreparable manner, but may be felt throughout the
whole body like an electric stroke, even though there be
no visible fire, or sensation of burning, as in the case of
the Italian priest and others, who perished in such a miserable
manner.</p>

<p>Formerly all acute diseases were supposed to depend
on morbific matter taken into the body, and absorbed
by the blood: the cure was thought to be accomplished
by the expulsion of this morbific matter from the body
by sweat, or some of the other natural evacuations.
The doctrine was attended by many difficulties, and in
many cases did not admit of a satisfactory explanation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
It was therefore laid aside, and the debility or excitement
of the nervous system arose in its place. But this
new system admitting of <i>miasmata</i> and <i>contagion</i>, it was
plain that morbific matter still kept its ground. With
a view, it would seem, to render the nervous theory more
complete, it has been found necessary to deny the doctrine
of contagion and infection entirely. This has been
done, wherever there was a possibility; but the phenomena
of the small-pox and measles, as well as those arising
from poisons, still militated strongly in favour of
morbific matter. To avoid the force of arguments
drawn from these sources, the doctrine of absorption was
denied, and contagions of all kinds were said to act immediately
upon the nervous system without affecting the
blood or other fluids. At last the matter seemed to be
decided by the experiments of the Abbe Fontana on
poisons. He found that some proved fatal by being
mixed with the blood, others by being applied to the
nerves, and others by being taken into the stomach.
Even this did not give satisfaction. It was contended
that the effects of poisonous bites were too quick to be
accounted for on the principle of absorption; that, after
the most violent symptoms had commenced, they might
be removed by cutting out the part affected; and consequently
that, instead of any absorption by the blood, we
were only to believe that the nervous system was irritated.</p>

<p>“Poisons, (says Dr. Girtanner) remedies, and, in general,
all surrounding bodies, acting only on the irritable
fibre, it follows that they act upon the system in
a similar manner, and that every substance capable of
producing the greatest possible effect upon the fibre,
that is to say, every substance capable of exhausting all
the irritability both of the fibre itself and of the system,
in an instant, as for instance, laurel water, or white arsenic,
is also capable of producing all the inferior degrees
of action, either by acting on a fibre less irritable,
or by acting upon the same fibre, but in a less quantity.
Laurel water, opium, white arsenic, ammoniac,
are of course both medicines and poisons capable
of <i>healing</i>, as well as of <i>producing</i>, <i>all maladies whatsoever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
without exception</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> And this is confirmed by a
number of experiments which I have made upon different
animals. This <i>truth</i> seems to me <i>of the utmost
importance</i>; and the Abbe Fontana, who made more
than six hundred experiments to prove that ammoniac
is no remedy against the bite of a viper, would have
saved himself the trouble, had he known it. If, instead
of applying the venom of the viper to so many animals,
and afterwards applying ammoniac to the wound, he
had made a single comparative experiment, and applied
ammoniac to a wound made by a lancet that was
not poisoned, he would have found that ammoniac
itself, applied in this manner, would have produced a
disease exactly analogous to that caused by the venom
of the viper; and, consequently, so far from removing
the malady, must necessarily increase it, by exhausting
the irritability of the fibre in a much less time than
the venom of the viper by itself was capable of doing.
Mr. Fontana has made more than six thousand experiments
upon the poison of the viper; he employed
more than three thousand vipers, and caused to be bit
more than four thousand animals; and the conclusion
he drew after this truly enormous number of observations
was, that the poison of the viper kills all animals,
and produces the disease by its action on the blood.
But why did Mr. Fontana neglect to make the decisive
experiment, the <i>experimentum crucis</i> of Bacon?
It is well known that frogs, and many animals with
cold blood, live a long time without the heart, and
entirely deprived of blood. If therefore the poison of
the viper kills animals by its action on the blood, it
will not destroy frogs without blood. But experiment
contradicts this reasoning. The poison of the viper
will kill frogs without blood in as short a time as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
kills those animals who have not lost their blood. It
is not therefore by its action upon the blood that the
venom of the viper destroys animals; and thus does it
happen that a single experiment frequently overturns
all that <i>six thousand</i> other experiments have apparently
established. According to my experiments, poisons
operate upon the blood just as they do upon the muscular
fibre, by depriving it of its principle of irritability,
or of its oxygen. After having made this observation
upon the experiments of Mr. Fontana, I must do him
the justice to add, that I have found all his experiments
very accurate, and that in all those which I have
repeated, the result has been exactly conformable to
the account given by him; it is in his conclusion only
that he appears to be deceived.”</p>

<p>On this I must in the first place observe, that since
<i>philosophers</i> and <i>truth</i> seem to be so far distant from each
other that even <i>six thousand</i> experiments cannot bring
them together, it were greatly to be wished that in their
researches they would pay a little more regard to humanity.
If the Author of Nature has set man at the head
of the creation, if inferior animals must patiently resign
their lives to preserve ours, are we therefore authorised
to torment and put them to death by thousands
for every idle whim that comes into our heads? After
Spallanzani, Fontana, Girtanner and a multitude of other
learned <i>barbarians</i> had cut in pieces, boiled alive, poisoned
and tortured thousands of inoffensive animals, new massacres
it seems must be made, and new tortures inflicted,
because an <i>experimentum crucis</i> is still wanted! If
knowledge is to be obtained only by such means as
these, it certainly must be derived from a very polluted
source.</p>

<p>2. The experiment on which Dr. Girtanner builds
so much is far from being above suspicion. Though
we may cut the heart out of an animal, and let it bleed
as freely as possible, yet we certainly overrate our abilities
if we say that <i>all</i> the blood is taken out of it. The
more perfectly an animal is bled, the less irritability it
has; which gives a reasonable suspicion, that, if <i>all</i> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
blood could be taken away, the irritability would cease
entirely. In frogs, and all other cold blooded animals,
the blood contains fewer red globules than in such as
are warmer; the circulation is more languid than in
such as have warm blood, and, of consequence, the
blood will retain its irritability for a longer time, and it
will likewise be more difficult to deprive the body of all
its blood. In making this experiment, therefore, Dr.
Girtanner ought to have brought unexceptionable proofs
that he had deprived the frog of <i>all</i> the blood it contained.
But, as this was not done, we shall be ready to
suspect that some was left; in which case we should be
still as uncertain as before whether the poison acted on
the irritable fibre, or on the blood. But the decisive
experiment, or <i>experimentum crucis</i>, seems to have been
made by Fontana himself, by injecting a little of the
diluted poison of the ticunas into the jugular vein of a
rabbit. Here the poison was applied to the blood itself.
It could get at no other part of the fibre but the inside
of the vein, which is not accounted very irritable; and
the quantity injected was so small, that the Abbe thought
his experiment had failed; yet the animal died as if by
lightning. The moment he turned his eyes towards it,
it was absolutely dead, without discovering the least
convulsive agony, or other sign of some little life remaining,
generally observable for some time in animals killed
by the common methods. On applying the same poison
to a large nerve of another animal of the same species,
no injury followed.</p>

<p>3. The dispute is of no consequence, and the experiment
will prove the same thing whether we suppose the
poison to act upon the irritable fibre (the nerves and
muscles) or upon the blood. The only important point
to be ascertained is, whether there be in nature any substance
which, applied to the internal parts of the body,
or to a wound, will instantly disorder the whole in such
a manner as to bring on a violent disease which may
prove mortal in a short time. If any such there is, that
substance, whether solid or fluid, visible or invisible, may
with propriety be called <i>contagion</i>; and if any such proceeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
from the body of a diseased person to one in health, the
vapour so proceeding is <i>infection</i>. As to the <i>mode</i> of its
operation we are little concerned; the sudden manner
in which people are affected shows that poisons kill by
suppressing in a very short time the principle of life,
which seems to be analogous to electricity, or rather the
very same with it; neither is it more incredible that the
poison of a serpent should kill by disturbing the natural
electricity of the body, than that the stroke of a torpedo,
or electrical eel, should kill by the same means. The
only difference is, that, in the case of poisons, the pernicious
substance is introduced into the body itself; in
the torpedo, it comes with violence from without. The
former we may compare to the silent discharge of an
electrified jar by a point, the latter to its discharge with
a violent flash by a knob. But that in poisonous bites
the blood is greatly affected, and that in a very short time,
we certainly know. There are some kinds of serpents
whose bites are so suddenly fatal, that no cure can be
applied: one of these, called the small <i>laharra</i>, is mentioned
by Mr. Bancroft in his Natural History of Guiana.
Mr. D’Opsonville, in his Philosophic Essays, takes
notice of one in the East-Indies, which he calls the <i>poison
serpent</i> or <i>serpent poison</i>, which seems to be as bad as
the <i>laharra</i> mentioned by Bancroft. This too is but
small, viz. two feet long, and very slender. Its skin is
freckled with “little traits of brown, or a pale red, and
contrasted with a ground of dirty yellow: it is mostly
found in dry and rocky places, and its bite proves mortal
in less than one or two minutes. In the year 1759,
and in the province of Cadapet, I saw several instances
of it; and, among others, one very singular,
in the midst of a corps of troops, commanded
by M. de Bussy. An Indian Gentoo merchant perceived
a Mahometan soldier of his acquaintance
going to kill one of these reptiles, which he had found
sleeping under his packet. The Gentoo flew to beg
its life, protesting that it would do no hurt if it was
not first provoked; passing at the same time his hand
under its belly, to carry it out of the camp; when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
suddenly it twisted round, and bit his little finger;
upon which this unfortunate martyr of a fanatic charity
gave a shriek, took a few steps, and fell down insensible.
They flew to his assistance, applied the serpent-stone,
fire, and scarifications, but they were all
ineffectual; his blood was already <i>coagulated</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> About
an hour after I saw the body as they were going to
burn it, and I thought I perceived some indications
of a <i>complete dissolution of the blood</i>.”</p>

<p>The bite of the <i>brulan</i> or <i>burning serpent</i>, according to
the same author, is almost as terrible. “This is nearly
of the same form with the last, its skin is not quite so
deep a brown, and is speckled with dark green spots:
its poison is almost as dangerous, but it is less active,
and its effects are very different. In some persons it is
a devouring fire, which, as it circulates through the
veins, presently occasions death; the blood dissolves
into a lymphatic liquor resembling thin broth, without
apparently having passed through the intermediate
state of <i>coagulation</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> and runs from eyes, nose and
ears, and even through the pores. In other subjects
the poison seems to have changed the very nature of
the humours in dissolving them; the skin is chapped
and becomes scaly, the hair falls off, the members are
tumefied, the patient feels all over his body the most
racking pains, then numbness, and is not long in
perishing.”</p>

<p>From these accounts it is plain that poisons do operate
very powerfully on the blood; and if they do so in
one case it is reasonable to think that they do so in all.
According to the degree of strength of the poison, however,
we are sure that the effects will be more or less visible
to us; but, though we should not be able to perceive
any alteration whatever in the consistence or colour
of the vital fluid, we cannot positively say that it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
not undergone any change; for the spirit which operates
in it is too subtile for our observation. In the beginning
of almost all diseases, perhaps, blood drawn from a
vein will not be perceptibly different from that of a person
in health; and Dr. Fordyce particularly takes notice
of this in fevers; but as the disease goes on, an alteration
becomes very perceptible, which gives just
ground for suspicion, that there had been some alteration
from the very first, though invisible to us.</p>

<p>After all our disputes, however, we shall find that the
controversy, though ultimately important, begins more
about words and trifles than any thing else. Dr. Brown
used the word <i>excitability</i>, Dr. Girtanner uses <i>irritability</i>,
and the author of this treatise, the words <i>vital spirit</i> and
<i>electricity</i>, to express something equally unknown to them
all. The only difference is, that Drs. Brown and Girtanner
speak of their excitability and irritability as a
kind of power essentially inherent in living bodies, acted
upon indeed by certain substances, but incapable of deriving
any supply from without; the author of this treatise
considers it only as a modification in the human body,
or an <i>organization</i>, if we please to call it so, of that fluid
which he believes to be universally diffused, under the
names of heat, light and electricity. Hence that portion
modified or organized in the human body must be
under an entire and absolute dependence upon the immense
mass of surrounding fluid, and, by any alteration
in the motions of it, must be often very perceptibly affected;
nevertheless as this fluid was originally created
to preserve and not to destroy human life, there is much
less danger from a <i>natural</i> than from an <i>artificial</i> commotion
in it. In some visible bodies, such as poisons,
the fluid acts in such a manner as to counteract the operation
of that part which is organized in the blood or
nerves, or both. Hence on the introduction of such
into the body the disorder flies like lightning through all
parts of it, and in a very short time brings on death.
In those vapours properly called <i>contagions</i>, the opposite
action is less violent, and therefore the disorders they produce
are in proportion. Hence such diseases may either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
be promoted or retarded by the perceptible properties of
the atmosphere, which in poisons have little or no effect.
There is indeed a remarkable difference in the strength
of the poison secreted in the bodies of serpents at certain
seasons of the year, or according to their food. M.
D’Opsonville observes that the poison of serpents is in
general more powerful, the more they live in hot and
dry places, where they feed upon insects that are full of
saline, volatile and acrimonious particles. But, notwithstanding
this difference in the strength of poisons according
to the circumstances of time and place, there is not
the least reason to suppose that poison of a given strength
would not produce the very same effects, let the state of
the atmosphere be what it would.</p>

<p>If therefore we certainly know that there are some
kinds of aerial vapours which when applied to the human
body do exert a power directly opposite to the vital
principle, there is no reason to doubt that such vapours
may be confined among certain soft substances, such as
cotton, wool, &amp;c. and remain there for an unknown
length of time, again exerting their malignant powers,
when a fresh object comes in their way. Besides, as all
kinds of air with which we are acquainted consist of a
basis united with the ethereal fluid and volatilised by it,
there is reason to suppose that contagions themselves are
formed in the same manner. Some kinds of air also are
very easily decomposed, in which case the basis attaches
itself to some terrestrial substance, the ethereal fluid
which volatilised it diffusing itself around in an invisible
manner, but generally with a perceptible heat. Fixed
air affords a notable example of this; for, by exposing it to
lime-water, or even dry lime, alkaline salt, volatile alkali,
or common water, a decomposition of the air very
readily takes place, and its basis is found to be attached
to those substances. What happens to fixed air may
also happen to <i>contagion</i>. The basis of it may have a
tendency to unite itself to cotton, or such like substances,
and thus may not only infect them, but concentrate
itself to such a degree as to produce a disease much more
violent than that of the person who gave the infection;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
and something of this kind has even been observed with
regard to infected cotton. But now another question
occurs: As fixed air, by being attached to terrestrial
substances, loses its aerial property, why should the basis
of contagious effluvia still retain its malignant quality
though in a state of decomposition? Here we are again
helped out by analogy. Fixed air is known to be capable
of resuming its aerial properties occasionally, from
causes unknown to us, though we cannot suppose them
to be any thing else than the invisible action of the
ethereal fluid so often mentioned; which, being guided
by laws unknown to us, we cannot possibly comprehend.
The fact, however, is certain, that the basis of fixed air
does very often quit the substances to which it is attached,
and assume an aerial state in great quantity, and
with very mischievous effects. Thus the old lavas of
volcanoes, if chemically tried will be found at <i>all</i> times
to contain great quantities of the basis of fixed air, but it
is only at <i>some</i> times that the mofetes which are supposed
to be the air itself, break forth<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> In like manner the
strata under ground always contain great quantities of the
aerial basis, but the <i>damps</i> in mines, which are certainly
known to consist mostly of fixed air, do not always appear;
neither do they gradually accumulate, but come
suddenly, spreading unexpected destruction among those
who unfortunately come in their way. The same may
take place with contagion. After remaining some time
in a state of decomposition it may have a tendency to
become volatile again, or it may lie dormant entirely;
and this last will explain what is quoted from Dr. Russel,
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_178">178</a>, that sometimes commerce may be carried on
with infected places without danger.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the dispute, originally begun about
a word, involves at last a matter of the utmost importance;
for, if it be found unreasonable to believe that
any such thing as contagion exists or can exist, it follows
of course that it is also unreasonable to take any precautions
against it. Mr. McLean even goes a step beyond
those who deny the existence of contagion; for we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
him also denying that putrid effluvia can produce epidemics;
according to which doctrine, it seems, we may
not only safely visit places accounted the most dangerous
on account of infection, but live in all manner of filth
and nastiness with impunity. It is plain that no person
can ever prove that it is impossible for contagion or any
thing else to <i>have an existence</i>. Indeed if nothing had
ever induced people to believe that it did exist, it would
have been superfluous to say any thing about it. But
when we have innumerable testimonies to the contrary;
when the opinions of the greatest physicians, as Dr. Lind,
Dr. Clarke, Dr. Mead, Dr. Sydenham, Dr. Fordyce,
Dr. Russel, &amp;c. agree that not only the plague, but
every kind of fever, is infectious; when we know from
the analogy of nature that contagion <i>may</i> exist; when
we know that there certainly <i>are</i> powers in nature able to
produce it; is all this to be thrown aside merely on the
strength of a theory, and a theory too which can never be
proved? for it is impossible to prove the <i>non-existence</i> of
any thing, much less the <i>impossibility</i> of its existence.
The lives of mankind are too precious to be sported
with on philosophical theories; and prudence will always
suggest, that wherever danger may at any time arise,
there it is proper to be on our guard.</p>

<p>Dismissing at length the subject of contagion in general,
we now enter upon the question, Whether doth it
appear from fair investigation of testimony, that the
plague has, at any time, been communicated by contagion
or not? And here I shall confine myself to what
has been adduced by Dr. P. Russel on the subject; for,
if we find that the disease has only <i>once</i> been introduced
by contagion, it signifies nothing though we were able
to prove, which we never can do, that it had been <i>an
hundred</i> times bred in some other way. The matter is
of too great importance to allow even a <i>chance</i> of its importation
by the neglect of the precautions necessary to
prevent it.</p>

<p>Our author begins with observing, that though the infectious
nature of the plague had been a question much
agitated in the schools, “it was less to be expected that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
physicians who had been engaged in practice among
the infected should have persisted in the opinion that
the disease was never communicated by contagion.”
Such, however, has been the case. In 1720 some French
physicians laboured exceedingly to prove that the plague
which then raged at Marseilles and throughout Provence
arose from corrupt humours bred in the body in
consequence of irregularity in the seasons, and bad aliment;
that it was spread by the same means, in concurrence
with terror, grief, despondence, or other debilitating
affections of the mind; but was neither bred nor
disseminated contagion. Dr. Russel mentions in a note,
seemingly with surprise, that “<i>so late</i> as the year 1778,
Dr. Stoll of Vienna should have written expressly
against the doctrine of pestilential contagion.” To
this professor he thinks it a sufficient answer to quote
the following passage from Mr. Howard on Lazarettos,
“It must appear very strange, that he should go back to
Livy’s Roman History for proofs to establish his point,
totally neglecting all the facts concerning the numerous
visitations of the plague recorded in modern medical
books, or which had happened during his own
time. I suppose professional men will lay very little
stress upon all that can be said on pestilential diseases,
in general, which happened in wars and sieges two
thousand years ago, as applied to the plague properly
so called, a disease then confounded with various
others from which the accuracy of latter observations
have sufficiently distinguished it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Russel complains of the French physicians at
Marseilles having made unfair representations; particularly
that while they produce as irrefragable arguments
against contagion their own escape unhurt, amid circumstances
of supposed danger, they pass slightly over, or
omit all mention of numbers of the medical assistants
whom they saw perish in the exercise of their profession.
M. Dedier, however, who at first opposed the doctrine
of infection, at last renounced his opinions so far as to
allow that the disease might be communicated to dogs
by injecting pestiferous bile into their veins; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
likewise admitted that it might be communicated from
one human creature to another, by drawing in for a considerable
time the breath of a diseased person, putting on
his shirt, lying in the same bed-clothes, and touching
the wounded parts of one’s own body with hands embrued
with the sweat or blood of one infected. He affirms,
however, that the atmosphere of a person in the plague
is no more to be dreaded than that of a venereal patient;
and that the touching or dressing of buboes or
carbuncles is not attended with any danger. He restricts
the infectious quality of the humours to the bile;
but the <i>inoculation</i> of a person by the matter of a pestilential
<span class="nowrap">ulcer<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> undoubtedly decides this point against
him.</p>

<p>On the subject of contagion Dr. Russel observes, that
the vague manner in which the word has been used has
given rise to much confusion. Some, taking advantage
of the inaccurate mode of expression on this subject used
by Dr. Mead, attacked him with sophistical nonsense.
The following may serve as a specimen, from a pamphlet
entitled “Distinct Notions of the Plague, &amp;c. by
the <i>Explainer</i>.” This <i>explainer</i> observes, that, according
to Dr. Mead, “air and his other causes propagate and
spread contagion, not the plague; and therefore either
contagion and the plague are the same, or else the
plague is not considered; if the first, then his causes
propagate the plague; and the plague accompanies
the plague; an excellent defence! But, if the plague
is out of the play, then contagion accompanies nothing.”&mdash;From
writers like this we certainly can expect
nothing.</p>

<p>The opinion of Dr. Cullen concerning contagion has
been already noticed, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_179">179</a>; but though he supposes
it to be a matter floating in the atmosphere, he observes
that contagions are never “found to act but when they
are near to the sources from whence they arise; that
is, either near to the bodies of men, from which they
immediately issue, or near to some substances which,
as having been near to the bodies of men, are embued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
with their effluvia, and in which substances these
effluvia are sometimes retained in an active state for a
very long time. The substances thus embued with
an active matter may be called <i>fomites</i>; and it appears
to me probable, that contagions as they arise from fomites,
are more powerful than as they arise immediately
from the human body.” This opinion concerning
the great power of contagion imbibed by certain
substances is conformable to what was above laid down
by reasoning <i>a priori</i> on the nature of contagion<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> It
is doubted by Dr. Russel, but Dr. Lind adopts it, and
Van Swieten gives his opinion to the same purpose.
“I am convinced, that the body of the diseased, kept
exactly neat and clean, is not so liable to impress the
taint, as his late wearing apparel, dirty linen, and uncleanliness
of any sort about him long retained in that
impure state. I say, these last contain a more concentrated
and contagious poison than the newly emitted
effluvia or excretions of the sick.”</p>

<p>With regard to the original cause, our author observes,
“that the plague is bred or produced originally from
vitiated human effluvia, is a matter which has by no
means been established on proper authority.” Setting
aside therefore inquiries of this kind, he thinks it sufficient
to inquire whether the infection be not communicated
from a sick to a sound person by immediate contact;
whether it be not also communicated at some distance
through the medium of the air; and whether substances
of various kinds do not imbibe the infectious effluvia,
and retain them for a considerable time. So far
as these points admit of proof from the experience of
times past, the question concerning pestilential contagion
will admit of a solution, independent of all theoretic reasoning
whatever.</p>

<p>2. On the subject of contagion people have been
embarrassed by confounding the true plague with other
malignant diseases. This has been done, not only by
the ancients, but by some moderns; and our author
quotes Dr. Pye, saying “that any epidemic sickness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
which rages with more than ordinary violence, and
which occasions extraordinary mortality amongst
mankind, may be, and is, properly termed a pestilence,
or the plague.” By not attending to the proper
distinctions, in these cases, circumstances belonging
to what are commonly termed malignant or pestilential
fevers will often come to be very improperly applied to
the true plague.</p>

<p>3. “It may be remarked, that those who contend
in favour of contagion, from zeal for accumulating
proofs, have collected a number of facts from historical
records of very unequal authority, and often with little
critical skill in discrimination. Of this error their
antagonists availing themselves, have selected from the
mass the instances most liable to doubt or objection,
and have endeavoured, by their manner of arranging
them, to place the whole in a ridiculous light; while
more important instances are either evasively past
over, misstated in the representation, or invalidated by
general declamation on the little credit due to historians
in matters of physic, or the prejudices prevalent
in ancient times of ignorance, and on contradictions
to be found in the arguments of those who support
the system of contagion.”</p>

<p>To this the Doctor adds the great quantity of hypothetical
reasoning which has been introduced into the
controversy, and above all the unfair dealing of the
parties in carrying on the dispute, which has reduced
the matter from “a calm inquiry in pursuit of truth,
to a wrangling contest for victory.” Lastly he insists,
that, had it not been for the misrepresentations and
sinister dealings of those who have written against contagion,
“the question seems to have been properly resolved
in the affirmative;” and he complains greatly of
the conduct of the Montpelier physicians in this respect,
insomuch that “their misstating of circumstances, and
the partiality so evidently discoverable in their narrative
of cases, will serve more effectually to remove
doubts on the subject, than any arguments that could
be used against their hypothesis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>On the subject of contagion our author observes,
that some difficulties still remain; but these, though
proper subjects of future inquiry, “do not appear to be
of force sufficient to invalidate facts already established.
It is well known, that the same person who has been
inoculated two or three times for the small-pox without
effect, even in an epidemic season, has afterwards
received the infection upon repeating the operation
at a distance of time when the disease was hardly sporadic.
The cause of this remains unknown; but ignorance
of it was never produced as an argument
against the reality of variolous contagion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If,
of one hundred persons exposed to the infection of
the plague by a near aproach to the sick, ninety
should fall sick, shall human inability to assign satisfactory
reasons for the escape of the other ten be converted
into a positive proof against the disease having
been caught by contagion? If persons retired from all
commerce with the infected and their attendants,
breathing the same air with the rest of the inhabitants,
and nourished by the same aliment, remain untouched
during the ravage of the plague, as long as they
continue secluded, but, upon unguarded communication,
are taken ill like others; can any rational doubt
be entertained about the cause of their former security?
Or if through stealth, or neglect of requisite
precautions, substances tainted by the sick should be
conveyed into these secluded retreats, and persons
living temperately as before, ignorant of what had
happened, and consequently in the midst of imaginary
security, happen to be seized with the distemper; can
it with any show of reason be ascribed, not to contagion,
but to terror, or to colluvies in the stomach and
bowels, produced by intemperance and bad aliment?
The instances here alluded to are not the <i>creation of
fancy</i>, but <i>strictly consonant to repeated experience</i> in
Turky; to say nothing at present of what has been observed
at Marseilles and in various cities in Europe.”</p>

<p>“But a greater difficulty than that of all persons not
being equally susceptible of the infection arises from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the cessation of the plague, at a period when the supposed
contagious effluvia, preserved in apparel, furniture,
and other fomites, at the end of a pestilential
season, must be allowed to exist, not only in a much
greater quantity than can be supposed to be at once
accidentally imported by commerce, but in a state
also of universal dispersion over the city: the fact,
however unaccountable, is unquestionably certain;
the distemper seems to be extinguished by some cause
or causes equally unknown as those which concurred to
render it more or less epidemical in its advance and at
its height. In Europe something may be ascribed to
the means employed for the cleansing of houses and
goods supposed liable to retain the latent seeds of infection;
but, at Aleppo, where the distemper is left to
take its natural course, and few or no means of purification
are employed, it pursues nearly the same progress
in different years: it declines and revives in certain
seasons, and, at length, without the intervention
of human aid, ceases entirely.”</p>

<p>On this we shall remark in general, that the failure of
contagion in some cases to produce the usual effects may
proceed from some constitution of the body, disposing it
not to allow the cause to produce its usual effects at one
time, though at another, the constitution may be so far
changed as very readily to admit it. This opinion has
been very generally received among medical people, who
have, to this singularity of constitution given the name
of <i>idiosyncrasy</i>. It is, however laughed at by Mr. McLean.
“As the fact (says he) cannot be denied, that a great
majority have escaped after contact with persons ill of
diseases supposed to be contagious, attempts may perhaps
be made to account for it by supposing a certain
peculiarity of constitution, which exempts from, or
disposes to, disease. Is it the many who escape that
have this happy peculiarity of constitution; or the few
who are seized that are so unfortunate as to possesses it?
The former are evidently too numerous to admit such
an hypothesis. The property must therefore, I conclude,
be given to the latter. But a child here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
there is exempted from small-pox, although exposed
to its contagion. In order to preserve a consistency,
this fact must be accounted for by the same or another
peculiarity of constitution. Peculiarities of constitution,
then, exempt from contagion in one case, and
dispose to it in another; and thus a term, which in
reality means nothing, may be made to account for
any thing. For my own part I confess my inability to
comprehend any other <i>peculiarities</i> of <i>constitution</i>, or
<i>idiosyncrasies of habit</i>, than what are constituted by the
different degrees of health and disease; the different
states of the excitability.”</p>

<p>In the same manner that Mr. McLean argues with
regard to disease, let us argue concerning bodily strength.
Some men are able to lift a weight of 6 or 700 pounds,
but a great majority cannot lift above 300. Whence
proceeds the difference? Is it the few who lift the great
weight that <i>by nature</i> have <i>more</i> strength, or is it the
many who can lift only the smaller that <i>by nature</i> have
<i>less</i>? This is precisely his argument, and there needs no
other refutation than stating it in this manner. What
he calls the states of excitability are as much <i>idiosyncrasies</i>
at the time as any thing else. Mr. McLean will not
deny that a person debilitated by certain causes is more
liable to be seized with typhus fever than one who is not.
What does this proceed from, but that the body of the
one is prepared for the disease, is <i>constitutionally</i> disposed
to receive it, or has an <i>idiosyncrasy</i> of habit disposing to
it, which the other has not? It is true, that unless we
point out the circumstances which constitute this idiosyncracy
we do nothing; but Mr. McLean’s scheme, of
resolving every thing into <i>excitability</i>, would forever prevent
us from doing so. This is the great deficiency of
the Brunonian system altogether; for, by attending
only to the animal life of the body, he seems to have
absolutely forgot that we had any thing in common with
vegetables. The bones, for instance, or indeed any part
of the body, cannot be formed by the power which governs
it after it was formed. The growth of the human
body is as strict vegetation as that of a tree; and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
we find that after the excitability is entirely gone,
after death has taken place for a considerable time, the
body still retains its form, and would do so forever, did
not other powers interfere with it. Human life therefore
is a compound of the vegetable and animal life, the former
being the basis of the latter; and it is the vegetable
life which is much more commonly the subject of disease
than the animal life. In vegetables we observe an <i>idiosyncracy</i>
of habit, as well as among animals. Some, even
of the same species, are much more vigorous than others,
and, among some, diseases are much more common than
others. In like manner among the human race some
are strong, others weak; in some the blood is much more
confident, and coagulates on exposure to the air much
more firmly than in others. Excitability, or excitement,
is common to all, and the degrees of it (though enumerated
by Yates and McLean in a kind of thermometrical
scale) must be merely imaginary, because excitability is
not the object of our senses. The obvious properties of
the body itself, independent of any excitement whatever,
are principally to be considered in medicine. These
constitute the peculiar constitution, or the <i>idiosyncracy</i> of
habit, belonging to each individual. Yet, in defiance
of every confederation of these obvious properties, which
all have access to observe, the new system leads us only
to consider an invisible and unknown being called <i>excitability</i>.
Hence diseases peculiar to certain constitutions
more than others are said to be occasioned only by certain
degrees of excitability common to all, or perhaps to
consist in these very degrees themselves. Thus a peculiar
mode of practice has been introduced, in which almost
the whole materia medica is rejected. We have
already quoted Dr. Girtanner, saying that <i>all diseases
whatever</i> may be <i>cured</i>, as well as <i>produced</i>, by only <i>four</i>
articles; but in the following quotation he goes still farther.
“The art of pharmacy and the science of prescription
will become useless; a phial of alcohol or
laudanum will supply the place of that enormous
quantity of drugs which crowd the shops of apothecaries.
The trade of the druggist&mdash;&mdash;but hold; if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
continue this prophetic language, I shall only expose
myself to ridicule,” &amp;c. Reveries of this kind certainly
deserve the most severe reproof. People may no
doubt amuse themselves with <i>theories</i> as well as any thing
else, while these theories continue inoffensive; but when
the belief of them leads to a rejection of what has been
established by the <i>experience</i> of many ages, they begin to
assume a consequence which they originally had not.
We have already seen that a disbelief of the doctrine of
contagion leads people into a practice accounted dangerous
by many, and which cannot be proved to be safe.
A total rejection of medicines, the efficacy of which
have been attested by thousands, and which never can
be proved to have <i>no</i> efficacy, must be attended with still
worse consequences, as thus we should be deprived of
the means of curing those diseases which our imprudence
in rejecting the former doctrine might have brought on.
But, to return to the subject of the plague.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the disease, while all the causes
that we suppose capable of producing it remain in full
force, is a demonstration that it depends on something
entirely distinct from the human body, and from all
those powers which perceptibly act upon it. It proves
that this unknown power has only a temporary existence,
coming to perfection at one season, and dying away in
another; sometimes capable of being revived, and sometimes
not. This corresponds entirely with what has
been laid down concerning contagion itself, viz. that
like other aerial vapours it is capable of decomposition,
and remaining for an uncertain length of time in a dormant
state; but that occasionally it may revive, and appear
unexpectedly, as <i>mofetes</i> arise from lavas, or damps
in mines. After a city has been thoroughly infected
with a pestilential disorder, therefore, there can be no security
against its re-appearance; it being impossible to
know whether the contagion may not be still existing
and capable of being revived by some unknown cause,
though it has been dormant ever so long. In such cases
it may with propriety be said to have arisen <i>spontaneously</i>,
though, had it not been there at a former period, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
could be no reason to think that it would have appeared
at that time.</p>

<p>Dr. Russel next takes into consideration the plague at
Marseilles in 1720, of which he says the accounts “are
more full, and circumstances better authenticated,
than most of the accounts of anterior plagues to be met
with in books.” From the opposition to the doctrine
of contagion at the time, he also supposes that the facts
relative to its introduction would be severely scrutinized,
and falsehoods detected: “but (says he) if, instead of
such detection, the most material have been passed
over in silence, and little more than hypothetical reasoning
opposed to others, the main facts may be considered
as established, if possible, more firmly than
they were before.” These facts are stated as follows:
“1. That the plague did not exist in France before the
25th of May, 1720. 2. That it was imported in
goods from the Levant, by a ship which left the coast
of Syria the beginning of February, and arrived at
Marseilles the 25th of May. Two days after her arrival
one of the sailors died; an officer of quarantine
who had been put on board died on the 12th of June,
and a cabin boy on the 23d. Some porters employed
in opening the merchandise at the lazaretto also died
about this time. Three others were taken ill in the beginning
of July, with buboes in the groin and axilla.
This alarmed the surgeon of the lazaretto; a consultation
was held with two other surgeons on the 28th;
the disease was unanimously declared to be the plague,
and the three patients died next day: the surgeon of
the lazaretto, with part of his family, and the priest
who attended the sick, were also taken ill and died.”</p>

<p>From the lazaretto the disease made its way into the
city, and began to appear about the 20th of June. By
what means it was introduced is not directly said; but
it seems to have been by smuggling infected goods. In
the beginning of July it began to spread; but a kind of
pause having taken place between the 12th and 23d,
the physicians were reproached with having mistaken the
distemper. During this supposed interval, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
it was discovered on the 18th of July that the disease
had spread in a certain part of the city. A surgeon,
employed to examine into the matter, declared the distemper
to be the worm-fever; and about the 23d the
council of health were informed of the death of fourteen
persons in that quarter, and of several others falling sick.
The surgeon still adhered to his opinion, but a physician
declared it to be the true plague. About the end of
the month it had got into the suburbs; four physicians
declared it to be the true plague, but their report was
not believed; they were insulted in the streets, and it
was not until some of the inhabitants of better rank
were taken ill, that the true state of the matter gained
credit.</p>

<p>“Such (says Dr. Russel) was the rise of the plague
at first, and its progress afterwards in the months of
June and July; whence it appears, that persons on
board the suspected ship, those employed in airing the
goods, a surgeon and a priest, who attended the sick,
were among the first infected; that the passengers
from the several ships, all of which ships, the first
excepted, brought foul patents, were, together with
their baggage, admitted into the city, after preforming
a quarentine of little more than eighteen days; that
the distemper from the 20th of June till towards the
end of July advanced very slowly, and sometimes seemed
to pause; that it attacked chiefly the poorer sort of
people, and was found in distinct quarters of the city;
and lastly, that, <i>during the first forty days, few or none of
the infected recovered</i>; a circumstance entirely consonant
to what was observed in the beginning of the
plague at Aleppo.”</p>

<p>Three other facts are mentioned by our author, viz.
that the disease was evidently communicated by infection;
that those who were careful to seclude themselves
from all communication with the sick and with infected
goods, were not infected; and lastly, that the
disease, which began to rage violently in August, continued
to do so through that and the following month,
but declined fast in the months of October and November,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and seemed to cease in the middle of winter. Some
accidents happened in 1721, between the months of
February and July, which gave occasional alarm; but
the distemper did not spread, and ceased entirely after
the summer solstice of that year.</p>

<p>To all this, however, objections have been made.
1. That the irregular seasons of the former year, a bad
crop, and unwholesome aliment, had produced a malignant
epidemic, all which, joined to the popular dread of
contagion, were sufficient to produce the plague without
any imported infection. To this Dr. Russel replies,
that these positions, assumed as facts, had no existence;
for which he refers to the publications of the times.
2. It was objected that there were instances of the plague
in Marseilles before the 25th of May. These instances
are only five in number, produced by M. Deidier, “who
saw not the cases himself, yet (says Dr. Russel) from
the very imperfect accounts he had been able to glean,
he thought himself justified in declaring they bore all
the marks of the true plague. Nothing (adds the
Doctor) but extreme partiality to an hypothesis could
have led any one practised in the plague, into such a
declaration; the cases bearing every internal mark of
belonging to a different class from the plague. I shall
endeavour to show this in a few words.</p>

<p>“Of the five supposed infected patients, three recovered,
two died, and all had eruptions. One who
died had a parotis (the most ambiguous of all pestilential
tumours) without any concurrence, so far as
appears, of pestilential symptoms. The tumour had
appeared six days before the woman’s death, but how
long she had been sick remains unknown. The other
died the 16th or 17th day, a very unusual period in
the plague. She also had a parotis, which did not
make its appearance till the 10th or 11th day of the
disease. No pestilential symptoms whatever are mentioned.
Of the three who recovered, one was very ill
with a fever and carbuncle; but neither the invasion
nor the duration of the disease are mentioned. Another
had a carbuncle and a small tumour on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
thigh; and the third (which bears the nearest resemblance
to a very slight infection) had also a bubo in
the thigh; but the tumours in neither of these patients
are described in such a manner as distinguishes
them from ordinary tumours; and the apothecary,
who gives the account from memory, had in all likelihood
never seen a pestilential bubo before.”</p>

<p>“Of the persons infected for some time after the arrival
of the ships from the Levant, none had eruptions,
and all perished after a few days illness; which
agrees entirely with what was observed at Aleppo in
the beginning of the plague: hardly any of the sick
recovered, and the major part died in three or four
days, without any appearance of buboes. Upon the
whole, therefore, I think it very clearly established,
that the plague did not exist in France before the
month of May, 1720. Prior to M. Deidier, however,
I find a M. Pons had endeavoured to prove
that the plague was in Marseilles, not only before the
month of May 1720, but even in the preceding year.
I have not had an opportunity of examining that gentleman’s
book.”</p>

<p>3. It is objected that the disease was not brought
from the Levant by infected goods. “Captain Chataud’s
vessel, supposed to have brought the infected
goods, arrived with a clean patent, or bill of health,
having left the coast of Syria before the plague broke
out there; she consequently cannot reasonably be
thought to have transported the plague, which was
not in the ports from whence she came.”</p>

<p>To this Dr. Russel answers, that on commercial accounts
the Turks carefully conceal the appearance of
the plague from the Europeans. Should reports of
accidents get abroad, they are variously and contradictorily
represented, and pestilential marks and tumours
fraudulently concealed. Though Chataud obtained a
clean patent, the plague broke out soon after his departure,
and three vessels with foul patents arrived at
Marseilles a few days after Chataud. “To this (says
Dr. Russel) it may be further added, that, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
his clean patent, persons acquainted with the
Levant will think it far from improbable, that the
plague might actually have been in Sidon when he
sailed, though unknown to the magistrate, by whom
the patents are granted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A clean bill of health
imports that the place has been free from plague, and
all suspicion of plague, for a certain space of time; but
the clean patents of the two first arriving from the
Levant, after the cessation of the plague, are, according
to Mr. Howard, deemed foul at Marseilles, and the
passengers are obliged to perform a quarantine of thirty-one
days. The French consuls lying under an obligation
to insert in their patents a detail of circumstances,
it must appear strange, when the condition of
Syria at that time is considered, how Captain Chataud
should have obtained a clean patent.”</p>

<p>Though this must certainly be deemed a sufficient
answer to the objection, Dr. Russel goes on to give an
account of what had happened the preceding year, when
the plague had raged violently at Aleppo; and shows
that, from the condition of the whole coast of Syria, a
return of the plague was certainly to be expected; that
the French consuls could not be ignorant of this, neither
could the council of health at Marseilles be unacquainted
with what had happened at Aleppo the preceding
year. “The facility with which the patents
seem to have been issued in Turky, and the partial
indulgence of the council to Chataud’s ship, notwithstanding
the very extraordinary mortality which had
avowedly happened on the voyage, together with their
easy confidence afterwards in the reports of the surgeon
of the lazaretto, can only be accounted for from the
prevailing influence of private commercial interest over
a sense of official duty.”</p>

<p>Our author next proceeds to take notice of what
happened during this ship’s voyage to Marseilles. On
the 31st of January he left the coast of Syria with a
clean patent, before the plague broke out. On the 25th
of May he arrived at Marseilles, from Sidon, Tripoli and
Cyprus. On the voyage, or at Leghorn, he lost six of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the crew; but, by the certificates of the physicians of
health at Leghorn, these died only <i>of malignant fevers
caused by unwholesome provisions</i>. These last words in the
Traite de la Peste are said to have been interpolated at
Marseilles. At any rate, as Dr. Russel observes, they
could relate only to those who died at Leghorn, not to
the others, whom the physicians had not seen.</p>

<p>The other account is much less favourable. According
to it, Chataud “left Sidon the 31st of January with
a clean patent. The plague discovered itself there
a few days after his departure. Having sustained some
damage by bad weather, he put into Tripoli, where he
embarked some merchandise; he took in also some
Turks, passengers for Cyprus, together with their luggage.
Soon after the ship had left Tripoli, one of
these passengers fell sick and died. Two of the sailors
employed to throw the corpse overboard desisted at the
desire of the pilot, and the rest of the ceremony was
performed by the other Mahommedan passengers;
the ropes with which the body was lowered down, being
by way of precaution thrown into the sea. Within
a few days the two sailors who had handled the
corpse were taken sick and died. At Cyprus the ship
put her remaining passengers on shore, and made a
very short stay. Soon after her departure from that
island, a third sailor and the surgeon died of an illness
of a few days duration. The captain, justly alarmed
by these accidents, ordered the bedding and other
things used by the deceased to be thrown into the
sea; and kept himself carefully separate from the
crew during the remainder of his voyage. Some time
after this three more sailors fell sick, and, there being
no surgeon on board, the vessel put into Leghorn,
where the three sick men died, and the physician and
surgeon of the lazaretto declared the disease to be a
malignant pestilential fever.”</p>

<p>Our author considers the above account as a full
proof of the plague being imported by Chataud’s vessel:
he declines entering into the question about the
<i>possibility</i> of importing contagion in merchandise. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
this <i>might</i> take place has already been explained; and
the present instance of its having been imported is as
clearly proved as can be expected. A collateral proof,
with regard to the contagion of the small-pox, we have
from Dr. Huxham. A beggar, ill of that disease, approached
a certain town in England, but was not suffered
to enter, for fear of infection. The beggar died, and
the infected clothes were burnt at some distance from
the town; but the smoke being blown upon it by the
wind, the small-pox in a short time made its appearance,
beginning in that part upon which the smoke was blown.
This clearly proves that <i>one</i> species of contagion may adhere
to clothes, and is a very strong presumption that
any other may do the same. It also shows that contagion,
when once produced, is by no means easily destroyed;
and consequently that all kinds of purification, even
when used with the utmost care and diligence, are scarce
sufficient to ensure safety.</p>

<p>It would now be superfluous to enter farther into the
subject of the plague being communicated by infected
goods, did not our author quote a work of Dr. Pye of
London, in which the latter from the very <i>Journal</i> (which
has been used as containing arguments in favour of contagion)
makes inferences directly opposite. “The facts
related in this journal (says Dr. Pye) seemed to me
to make so clearly against the modern doctrine of contagion,
that if this writer had not mentioned them as
undeniable instances in his favour, I should not have
thought there had been any persons here in England so
dull of understanding, or so much blinded with prejudice,
as to stand in need of having these facts put
into a more obvious light: but, having this occasion,
I shall consider them more largely than otherwise I
would have done, and show that the porters, who died
in the lazaretto at Marseilles, received no hurt or
infection from the goods.</p>

<p>“To leave no room for objection, I shall take notice,
that a guard of quarantine died on board Chataud’s
ship the 12th of June; but, as this officer was no
ways concerned either in unloading or opening the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
goods, he could receive no hurt from them; and besides,
this must have been fourteen or fifteen days after
the goods had been carried out of the ship into
the lazaretto. Further, six of their men are said to
die at Leghorn; but the town of Leghorn was not infected
from thence, which would have been more
likely if there had been any infection in the case, than
that Marseilles should be afterwards infected.</p>

<p>“If any infection or infectious <i>aura</i> can be supposed
to be packed up, and brought in goods, such infection
or infectious aura must necessarily issue forth from
them in greatest abundance, and with the greatest
force, at the first opening or unpacking of them; and,
as it must continue to fly off every moment, and be
thereby continually diminishing, it is likewise certain,
that in a very few days the goods must be in a
great measure, if not entirely, cleared of it. Wherefore,
if the porters could have been infected from the
goods at all, it must have been at the first opening of
them: but, even according to this journal, the porters
that first fell sick were not taken ill before the 23d of
June, whereas Chataud’s ship arrived the 25th of May
preceding; so that the goods of that ship, in purifying
which the porter first mentioned was employed, had
been airing and purifying for twenty-six or twenty-eight
days before this accident happened; and it cannot
be conceived that after so long a time they should
not have been entirely purged of all infection or infectious
aura, if any could have been brought with them.
Or if it can be supposed, which I think impossible, that
any part might still be left, it must withal be supposed
so much less than at first, as not to be capable of doing,
those porters especially, the least hurt: to suppose
otherwise would be to argue that the same man who
some days before had received and borne a very great
quantity and force without any injury, could then be
killed by a quantity and force infinitely less.</p>

<p>According to the report of merchants, <i>Frenchmen
are not subject to the plague in Turky</i>; and it cannot
be conceived that so small a quantity of infectious air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
as can be packed up and brought in a bale of goods,
should destroy them in France, or in an air and climate
distant and different; when the whole atmosphere
of the same infectious air is found not to injure
them in very infected places, and wherein it is allowed
to be bred and generated.”</p>

<p>Thus far Dr Pye.&mdash;Let us now hear Dr. Russel in
answer.</p>

<p>“The death of the quarantine officer was mentioned
in order to leave no room for objection; but still it
may be objected that he has omitted the death of
the sailor on the 27th of May, and asserted, in contradiction
to the journal, that the former six sailors
died at Leghorn. That Leghorn was more likely to
be infected than Marseilles, is a strange notion. The
ship had landed no goods there, nor had any intercourse
with the shore; for the physician who visits
the sick on board, remains at a distance from the ship,
in a boat, and the dead bodies are sunk in the sea.
As to the circumstance of the goods of Chataud’s vessel
being all in the lazaretto before the 12th of June,
it is a supposition to be attributed to Dr. Pye’s unacquaintance
with matters of that kind; for it is impossible
a ship which arrived the 25th of May should
discharge the whole of her cargo in two or three days.
The dispatch would have been miraculous, considering
the ship lay near two leagues from the lazaretto,
and was unloaded, and the boats navigated, by her
own crew. It did not occur to Dr. Pye, that some
time, previous to the vessels beginning to unload, is
taken up in examination and other forms at <i>Pomegue</i>,
and the council of health. The loss of six men on the
voyage was an extraordinary circumstance, that required
deliberation; and it appears that on the 29th,
after the death of the sailor on board Chataud’s vessel,
the council determined the quarantine of his
cargo to be forty days, commencing from the landing
of the last bale; which was double the time usually
allowed for a ship with a clean patent. It is very
probable, therefore, that the ship did not begin to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
unload till after the 29th of May, and possibly had
not finished when the quarantine officer died, the 12th
of June, who must have been taken ill two or three
days before.</p>

<p>“In regard to the time requisite for the complete
evaporation of the infectious aura, in what proportionate
gradation its activity is impaired by ventilation,
and the specific quantity required to produce
effect on the human body, they are matters which I
apprehend will not readily be admitted to be clearly
and certainly known. That the first porters were
not taken ill before the 23d of June, is very true;
but that the goods had been airing and purifying for
twenty-six or twenty-eight days, has been shown above
to be an error. The Doctor also makes two other
suppositions equally erroneous. The first, that the
whole of the cotton contained in a number of bales
is equally imbued with infectious aura; the second,
that all the bales of a ship’s cargo are opened nearly
about the same time. But, as the cotton contained
in these bales may not only have been collected from
different villages at different times, but packed up
under various circumstances relative to the materials
used for embalage, and the persons employed in embaling
or steeving them; it may easily be conceived
how the cargo of a ship, coming even from a place
where the plague actually rages, may be only partially
infected, or not infected at all. The warmest
advocate for contagion never contended for every
bale of a ship’s cargo being equally infectious. As
to the airing of the bales, it is a laborious and a
tedious process. Where there is a considerable
number, it takes up several days to open and arrange
them, goods of different kinds must be disposed separately,
accounts taken, and the cordage, &amp;c. laid up
with care where it may be found again. The laborious
part of these operations is performed by the porters,
who also transport the goods from the water side to the
enclosure where they are to be aired: and, as the days
of quarantine do not begin to be reckoned till all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
goods are landed, the porters for some days at the beginning
are sufficiently employed in receiving and arranging
the cargo, that being the business requiring the
first dispatch. When these circumstances are considered,
it will appear no extravagant supposition, that
some of the last opened bales of Chataud’s cargo might
still retain enough of infectious aura to infect the porter
on the 23d of June. To set this retardment, almost
unavoidable in the opening of bales, in a still clearer
light, it should be observed, that, by the regulations
at Marseilles, all suspected goods are subject to what is
termed <i>sereines</i>; that is, a certain number of bales are
taken out of the hold, and, being opened at both ends,
are exposed to the air for two, three, or six days, by
way of trial, in order to see if any signs of infection
should appear among those employed in handling the
merchandise. When these have been aired, more or
less, according to circumstances, another parcel is
opened and exposed to ventilation in like manner:
so that, according to the burden of the ship, there may
be several of these sereines, each of several days duration.
In this manner, independent of accidental impediments
from wind and weather, in sending the goods
from the ship, it maybe supposed, were it at all necessary
to make the supposition, that the porters, not only
on the 23d of June, but on the 7th and 8th of July,
were infected upon opening some new bales. As to
the porter being infected by goods from another ship,
Dr. Pye thinks it impossible, because the ship had been
twelve days in port, and the goods must have been
eight or nine days in airing and purifying: had he
been acquainted with the practice of the sereines in
quarantine, he would have been at no loss to make the
accident agree exactly with his notion of the infectious
aura.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The plain matter of fact, as it stands in
the journal, is this, that six porters, employed in purifying
suspected merchandise from the Levant, died
of the plague; and their death was followed by that
of the surgeon who attended them, and part of his
family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>From this the reader will be able to judge how far the
question is decided in favour of the fact that the plague
at Marseilles was actually produced by imported contagion.
It seems needless to follow our author through
his investigation of those facts which his adversaries have
misrepresented; for these must of course be in his favour;
every misrepresentation by a disputant being plainly an
abandonment of his cause. Indeed the argument against
contagion at that time was properly but one, and is set
forth in no stronger language now than formerly. Even
as long ago as 1665 Dr. Russel quotes one Gadbury an
astrologer stating the difficulty as strongly, and giving a
solution of it as clearly, upon <i>his</i> principles, as the best
modern theorists can do upon <i>theirs</i>. “If the pestilence,
(says Mr. Gadbury) be infectious, and really catching
in itself, it must be so equally to all persons that
approach it, or that it approacheth; or else it must be
infectious to some particular persons only. If it be
infectious to all persons, or catching to all alike, then
all persons, that come into the sight or within the scent
of it, must necessarily be subject unto it. If not infectious
unto all, but unto some particular persons only,
I say then it ought not to be deemed or esteemed
infectious at all, at least not any more infectious than
are all other diseases, viz. small-pox, scurvy, pleurisy,
ague, gout, &amp;c. since (though the notion of infection
be laid aside) there is not a person born into the world
that hath not at some time of his life (as his <i>nativity</i>
shall truly show) some one disease or other. Never
was any person subject to violent diseases, as plague,
&amp;c. but had a violent <i>nativity</i> to show it, and <i>e contra</i>.”</p>

<p>The answer to this has been already given.&mdash;Let any
other cause than contagion or infection be supposed, and
the difficulty remains equally great. The probability is
in favour of contagion, rather than a general disposition
of the atmosphere, because in the latter case the disease
would, contrary to experience, begin in a great many
places at once; but the plague begins in such a secret
manner that we scarce know whence it comes. Like fire,
or a ferment in liquors, it diffuses itself far and wide, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
lastly, like an immense inundation, the source of which is
dried up, it seems to lose its power by extending too far,
and dies away altogether. We cannot penetrate into
the causes of those things, but, without any speculation
at all, we can observe that the disease falls upon people
of a certain constitution more than others, and this may
be of use in preserving ourselves from it, as shall be
explained in the next section.</p>

<p>It is still necessary to say something of the infection
spreading from one person to another, and being kept off
by refraining from communication with the diseased.
This indeed naturally follows from its proceeding originally
from the cotton: for as all the infected did not
touch this cotton, there can be no other cause assigned
from its spreading than by communication from one to
another; and, therefore, if such communication was cut
off, we should naturally think that the disease would not
spread. But, in opposition to this, we have already
quoted Dr. Moseley giving a long list of convents infected,
though they kept themselves strictly shut up. Dr. Russel
cites, in favour of prevention by shutting up, two
certificates, one by the bishop of Marseilles, the other
by the sheriff of the same place. To these he adds the
testimony of M. Langeron, who was actively employed
throughout the whole time that the plague continued,
first as a commodore of the gallies, and afterwards as
governor of the town and its dependencies. In opposition
to these, however, he takes notice of two passages
“in books of acknowledged authority,” which he is at
pains to answer; the one is from the Journal already quoted,
which says, “and what is unaccountable, those
who have shut themselves up most securely in their
own houses, and are the most careful to take in nothing
without the most exact precautions, are attacked there
by the plague, which creeps in no one knows how.”
The other passage is taken from the <i>Relation Historique</i>,
“that, in the height of the pestilence, the infection
penetrated into places which had till then remained
inaccessible; that monasteries and houses shut up in
the most exact manner were no longer places of security.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>To the former of these our author answers, that “from
the manner of stating the case, one would think that
all these religious had been close shut up, without any
communication with persons without doors; and this
was certainly intended by an author who has made
remarks upon it; but it will be found, upon looking
into the beginning of the very paragraph cited, that
the greatest part of them are represented as martyrs
who had meritoriously exposed themselves. Of the
twelve different orders mentioned on this occasion,
the Grand Augustines only are said to have kept in
their convent. But, supposing the Augustin convent
to have been actually shut up, and in that state infected;
it would by no means invalidate the instances
brought of the preservation of the convents, the certificates
concerning which were granted deliberately,
after all was over; whereas the journal, written from
day to day, marking circumstances rapidly as they
occurred, the author, amongst various other affairs, had
not always leisure or opportunity to examine minutely
into circumstances. It is in this light I am inclined
to consider the houses being infected which took in
nothing without the most exact precautions; and the
rather, because I met with several instances of the like
kind at Aleppo, in the houses of the Christian and
Jewish nations: but in the sequel it generally appeared
there had been some improper communication carried
on by the domestics, unknown to the family at
the time.”</p>

<p>“That the atmosphere, in a city so dreadfully circumstanced
as Marseilles, may become so highly
tainted as to convey the plague into houses shut up,
cannot confidently be affirmed to be impossible, by
those who hold mediate contagion; and the concurrence
of circumstances at that period in Marseilles, renders
it highly probable that such accidents happened.
But, in general, the pestiferous effluvia once emitted
into the air, do not appear to operate at any great
distance from their source; and M. Deidier asserts,
that two monasteries (from their situation, one near a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
burial ground, the other near a pest-house) very dangerously
situated, remained nevertheless untouched,
which he thinks an argument against infection being
conveyed by the air.”</p>

<p>From this long and contested account of the manner
in which the plague was received into Marseilles, we see
how very difficult it must be to come at a true state of
facts, when a number of people think it their interest to
misrepresent or conceal them. The limits of this treatise
will not allow us to follow our author through the
numerous details of misrepresentations and unfair methods
which the adversaries of the doctrine of contagion
have made use of to establish their opinion: neither
shall we enter into any discussion concerning the origin
of other plagues, as we should in them find the same
opposite kinds of evidence without such documents for
distinguishing the true from the false as Dr. Russel has
produced in the case of Marseilles. A single fact only,
mentioned by Mr. Howard in his Treatise on Lazarettos,
shall be related, and which, if allowed to be <i>fact</i>,
decides the question as effectually as a thousand.</p>

<p>“When the plague raged at London in 1665, it was
conveyed to the remote village of Eyam near Tideswell
in Derbyshire. In this place it broke out in September
1665, and continued its ravages upwards of a year,
when two hundred and fifty of the inhabitants had
died of it. The worthy rector, Mr. Mompesson,
whose name may rank with those of Cardinal Borromeo
of Milan, and the good bishop of Marseilles, at
its breaking out, resolved not to quit his parishioners,
but used every argument with his wife to quit the infected

and is supposed to have died of the plague.
They sent away their children. Mr. Mompesson constantly
employed himself, during the dreadful visitation,
in his pastoral office, and preached to his flock
in a field, where nature had formed a sort of alcove
in a rock, which place still retains the appellation of
a church. He survived, and the entries in the parish
register relative to this calamity are in his own hand
writing, viz.</p>

<p>This plague is said to have arisen from a box of
clothes sent from London while the distemper was at its
height in that city. But whether this be admitted or
not, it cannot well be supposed that in a small village
there could either be a peculiar constitution of the air,
collections of filth, immoderate heat, cold, or in short
any general cause from which a plague could be supposed
to arise, that would not have affected the country
for a great way round. How then came this insulated
spot to be so violently affected, except by contagion?
No matter whether by clothes or any thing else. The
very particular manner in which the numbers who
died are recorded, leaves no doubt as to the fact of the
distemper having been there; neither is it possible to
account for its rise on any other principle than contagion.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard, previous to his going abroad, had been
furnished, by Dr. Aikin and Dr. Jebb, with a set of
queries relative to the plague, to be put to the physicians
in the different countries through which he travelled.
This commission he executed with great fidelity
and exactness. The physicians to whom he proposed
them were, <i>Raymond</i> of Marseilles, physician;
<i>Demollins</i> of do. surgeon; <i>Giovanelli</i>, physician to the
lazaretto at Leghorn; <i>They</i>, to do. at Malta; <i>Morandi</i>,
physician at Venice; <i>Verdoni</i>, at Trieste; <i>Jew</i> physician
at Smyrna; <i>Fra. Luigi di Pavia</i>, prior to the hospital
of San Antonio at Smyrna. The questions proposed
were as follow:</p>

<p>1. Is the infection of the plague frequently received
by the French?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>Though this was not asking in direct terms whether
the plague is infectious or not, all to whom it was proposed
seem to have viewed it in this light, Raymond of
Marseilles only excepted, who answered directly, “Sometimes
it is.” All the rest, except Giovanelli, agreed that it
might be communicated by the touch, or by the breath.
Verdoni gave an instance of its being communicated by
a flower which three persons smelt at; two remained
free, but the third sickened and died in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>2. Does the plague ever rise spontaneously?</p>

<p>In this Verdoni alone answered positively in favour of
the spontaneous rise of the plague. <i>They</i> spoke ambiguously.</p>

<p>3. To what distance is the air infected? How far
does actual contact, wearing infected clothes, or touching
other things, produce the disease?</p>

<p>To this question Verdoni answered in a manner seemingly
inconsistent with his former answer; allowing not
only that the plague was infectious, but that infected
things might communicate the disease after an interval
of many years. All agreed that the strength of the infection
was greater or less according to circumstances;
the distance at which it could act was likewise uncertain.
Raymond said that the sick might be safely conversed
with, across a barrier, at a few paces distance; the Jew
said at <i>two ells</i> distance, provided the chamber windows
be not all shut. Giovanelli said it had been proved that
the infection did not extend beyond five geometrical
paces. The touch of infected clothes, or drawing in
the breath of the sick, was looked upon by him and
Fra. Luigi to be very dangerous.</p>

<p>4. What are the seasons in which the plague chiefly
appears; and what is the interval between the infection
and the disease?</p>

<p>To this it was answered by Raymond, that the two
solstices are the times in which it has least power. The
others agreed that hot and moist weather was favourable
to its ravages; the spring, summer and first month of
autumn are dreaded. These circumstances, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
must be variable in different countries. As to the time
in which the infection shows itself, the answer was various.
According to <i>They</i>, it “sometimes acts slowly,
sometimes like a <i>stroke of lightning</i>.” According to
Verdoni, “the disease generally shows itself at the instant
of touch, <i>like an electrical shock</i>.” Sometimes the
infection will be communicated from a sick person to a
sound one, who without any disease may communicate
it to a second, and that second to a third, in whom alone
it would become active.</p>

<p>The other questions, relative to the symptoms, prevention
and cure of the distemper, will be taken notice of
in the course of the treatise. In the mean time having
discussed, with a prolixity almost exceeding our bounds,
such preliminaries as seemed most likely to throw some
light on the nature of the distemper, we shall now proceed
to the medical history of the plague, as we find it
laid down in different authors.</p>

<p>Though this distemper has most frequently been accounted
a <i>fever</i> in the highest degree, yet, as we have already
noticed, it seems to be essentially different<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> The
testimonies there quoted are sufficient to establish the
fact; and, were it needful, many others might be brought
from authors both ancient and modern. In the plague
said to have taken place in the days of Romulus<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span> Plutarch
relates, that the people died without any sickness.
To this very ancient testimony we shall add that of Dr.
Patrick Russel, who closes the account of his first class
of patients with the following paragraph: “That the
plague, under a form of all others the most destructive,
exists without its characteristic eruptions, or
other external marks reckoned pestilential, can admit
of no doubt; and it is to be regretted that mankind
have so often, from the absence of these, been betrayed
into errors of fatal consequence on its first invasion;
at which early period human prudence can only be
exerted in the way of defence with any probability
of success.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>The symptoms of this fatal disease were sometimes a
sudden loss of strength, confusion or weight in the head,
giddiness at intervals, oppression about the præcordia,
dejection of spirits, taciturnity, an anxious aspect, but
without any symptoms of fever. In these, death ensued
within twenty-four hours; some were said to have died
within a few hours, but our author saw none of these,
and is inclined to doubt the truth of the accounts, having
in several instances, where this is said to have happened,
found upon inquiry that matters had been inaccurately
stated, and that the patients had really been ill
one or two days.</p>

<p>In others the disorder was more perceptible. In a
few hours the eyes became muddy, the surface of the
body cold, with drowsiness, lethargy, and pain at the
heart. In the progress of the distemper they frequently
lost the power of speech, the skin seldom recovered its
warmth, or, if it did, it was only by irregular flushings.
The pulse sometimes remained nearly in its natural state,
but was, for the most part, low and quick. They were
“by turns delirious, confused and sensible, but the comatose
disposition was most prevalent. Towards the
end they suffered extreme inquietude. Vomiting in
some occurred the first night; in others a diarrhœa
next day; both accelerating the fatal period; but
these symptoms were less frequent than in some of the
other classes. Buboes appeared only in a very few
who survived the third day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The total absence
of buboes in such patients as perished suddenly I have
no doubt of, nor of their being in general very rare in
others of this class; though I suspect that the buboes
might sometimes have been concealed, where the disease
ran out to the fourth or fifth day, and for the
same reason that the reports concerning the state of
the corpse were sometimes not true.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was
very rare to find suspicious marks of infection on the
bodies [of those who died within 24 hours].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Carbuncles were seldom visible till the month of May,
which was later than this form of the disease. It prevailed
chiefly at the rise of the plague in 1760, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
its revival in the two succeeding years, decreasing as
the distemper spread; and though they were found
dispersed in every stage of the pestilential season, yet
the number of this class was proportionably small,
compared with that of others. Petechiæ, vibices, or
broad, livid, roundish spots, occurred sometimes, but
were not common, and the two latter were seldom visible
till after death.”</p>

<p>This account of the most malignant form of the pestilence
differs considerably from that of Dr. Hodges, who
seems to think that the <i>tokens</i>, as he calls them, very
generally were to be found on the bodies of those who
died suddenly. He mentions indeed a young man who
was suddenly seized with a violent palpitation of the
heart, and thus continued till his death, which took
place in a few hours. In this case the Doctor supposed
that there might be a carbuncle broke out on the heart.
Dr. Russel has considered the description of the tokens
given by Dr. Hodges, and compared it with that of
others called by Diemerbroeck <i>maculæ mortis</i>, <i>spots</i> or
<i>tokens</i> of <i>death</i>; and by this comparison it appears that
the former has spoken somewhat indistinctly on the subject,
confounding two different kinds of eruptions together.
Dr. Hodges, however, as we have already seen
(p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_10">10</a>) asserts, in his <i>Loimologia</i>, that the tokens rise from
within, and are broadest at their bases, where he also supposes
the pestilential poison chiefly to lie. To the same
purpose, in his Letter to a Person of Quality he says,
“The tokens have their original and rise from within,
and afterwards externally show themselves; which is
evident, because the basis of them is larger than their
outward appearance, and the internal parts are found
very often spotted, when there is no discoloration
visible on the skin.” Dr. Russel, after quoting Diemerbroeck,
makes the following observations: “The
author (Diemerbroeck) is diffuse on this subject, and
thinks it a mistaken though prevalent notion, that the
maculæ are merely superficial in the skin, proceeding
from putrefaction, ebullition, &amp;c. in the blood or humours:
on the contrary he affirms, they arise from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
internal parts, even the periosteum, broad at the base,
and tapering to their termination in the skin, being
produced by the <i>extinction</i> and <i>extravasation</i> of the vital
spirits. Now (says Dr. Russel) this answers exactly
to one species of the tokens described by Hodges,
which therefore may be reckoned the same with the
<i>maculæ mortis</i>, and was probably the only one observed
at Nimeguen,” &amp;c. On the same subject he quotes
a book entitled <i>Medela Pestis</i>, in which the author says
that by careful dissection the <i>tokens</i> may be traced half-way
deep in the flesh, and some, in the muscles of the
breast, have been followed by the incision knife even to
the bone. By the directions given by authority to the
searchers in 1665, they were ordered to look narrowly for
these tokens, which were described as “spots arising on
the skin, chiefly about the breast and back, but sometimes
also in other parts. Their colour is something
various, sometimes more reddish, sometimes inclining
a little towards a faint blue, and sometimes a brownish
mixed with blue; the red ones have often a brownish
circle about them, the brownish a reddish.”</p>

<p>On the subject of tokens Dr. Hodges further observes,
that they differed also in their degrees of hardness,
some being easily penetrated with a needle or
penknife, while others, more callous or horny, were
penetrated with more difficulty. They so strongly
resembled warts, that they could scarce be distinguished
from them; and Dr. Hodges himself was often obliged
to have recourse to a needle for this purpose. They
seemed hard to the touch, not unlike kernels under the
skin, the superfices being smooth. “When I essayed
to prove some of them (says he) I found them <i>almost
impenetrable</i>.” Another very remarkable circumstance
relative to them was, that they were often quite insensible,
and this distinguished them from the carbuncle,
which is always very painful. Hodges also remarks,
that a quick sensibility in the skin was always a good
sign, and those that went no farther than the skin would
sometimes slough off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>Along with these tokens we can scarce doubt that
<i>petechiæ</i> and <i>vibices</i> made their appearance. The former,
even in the inferior degrees of the distemper, were
dangerous, the latter always fatal, never appearing till
the patient is within a few hours of death, sometimes indeed
not till death has taken place. Of the petechiæ Dr.
Russel says, that for the most part they predicted death,
but not without exception. Such as he observed were
round, somewhat smaller than a recent flea-bite. They
were distinct, few in number, and scattered irregularly
about the breast and mastoid muscles. When they did
not appear till the approach of death, they were from
the first livid, or very dusky; but if they appeared early,
they were of a less deep colour, changing afterwards to
livid. Hodges speaks of them as deeper coloured than
the spots of malignant fever, not fixed in any particular
spot, sometimes few, but commonly very numerous; the
colour sometimes red or purple, sometimes yellow, and
sometimes livid or black. From Gotwald, Russel quotes
a description of these spots, which he divides into four
species. 1. Reddish, like flea-bites, soon growing brown
or black; appearing on all parts of the body except the
face. 2. In the form of lentils, spreading like the former
all over the body; ruddy at first, but in 24 hours growing
dark or ash-coloured. 3. Large brown spots, scattered
here and there, sometimes intermixed with the lentil kind.
4. Not unlike the measles, spreading all over the body,
rising afterwards in small blisters without any matter,
vanishing about the fifth day. Russel also takes notice
of a species of petechiæ which were very numerous, confluent,
and of a dark red or dusky colour and irregular
figure. These were sometimes remarked in the interstices
of the former. Such instances occurred but rarely.</p>

<p>The vibices were much larger than the petechiæ.
Gotwald says that they covered the face as high as the
nose, and from thence spread to the forehead, disfiguring
the patient in a frightful manner. They did not appear
till a short time before death. Often they appeared unexpectedly,
shooting up like lightning from the breast
to the face, in spots of various colours, blue, green, brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
and yellow. Diemerbroeck describes them as oblong
spots of a livid or black colour, like strokes drawn with a
pen; sometimes they were larger, the biggest resembling
the strokes of a whip. Russel takes notice of a kind of
marbled appearance which took place at the height of
the disease, or a few hours before death; the colours being
a faint blue, and darkish red, both more or less obscure
at times, but never bright. It was not permanent,
vanishing in one place, without leaving any trace, and
returning at short intervals. “The skin in various places
was sometimes deformed by narrow streaks of reddish
purple, or livid colour. When such took possession
of the face they gave a frightful appearance to the
countenance, and frequently made such an alteration
in the features, and so completely disguised the patient,
as to render him hardly <i>knowable</i> by his acquaintance.
A streak nearly of the same kind was sometimes observed
darting from the edges of the buboes and carbuncles.
The vibices or weals were much longer and
broader, and more exactly resembled the marks left in
the fleshy parts by blows or stripes; they were found
chiefly on the thighs, buttock, and back, and made
their appearance several hours before death, in some
cases, but in others not till after. Large blue or purple
spots, the <i>maculæ magnæ</i> of authors, were sometimes
observed with or without the vibices, a little
while before the patient expired, but most commonly
were discovered only on the corpse. Their figure in
general was round, sometimes irregular.”</p>

<p>Whether all these mortal signs appeared on such as
died very suddenly of plagues, and were by the English
writers confounded under the general name of <i>tokens</i>,
cannot certainly be determined. Dr. Russel saw none
who died within the twenty-four hours, and few who died
within thirty hours, so that we cannot from him expect
any particular account of the situation of those who
died suddenly. In general, however, he says, that “in
the most destructive forms of the plague, the vital
principle seems to be suddenly, as it were, extinguished,
or else enfeebled to a degree capable only for a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
while to resist the violence of the disease; in the subordinate
forms, the vital and animal functions, variously
affected, are carried on in a defective, disorderly
manner, and denote more or less danger accordingly.”
It seems probable therefore that in those who are suddenly
killed, the same effects take place in a short time which
are observed to take place after a longer space in those
who die gradually, buboes only excepted, which require
for their formation a longer time than is allowed to the
patient to live. Internal mortifications, or rather eschars,
are therefore to be suspected, and dissections have evinced
that this was really the case; but besides these there
was an appearance observed in the plague at Marseilles
which is not taken notice of by former physicians; viz.
a preternatural enlargement of the heart. M. Deidier
on that occasion communicated an account of nine dissections,
but of these only one had died without eruptions.
This was a woman of 40 years of age, who lived
till the third day. In her “the <span class="nowrap">mediastinum<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> was torn
towards the upper part; the pericardium of a livid colour;
the heart larger than in its natural state, by the
swelling of its ventricles; full of thick, black blood.
The liver was also very large, and of a livid colour, with
a carbuncular pustule on the side of the gall-bladder,
which was filled with very black bile.” In others
who had eruptions, and who of consequence we must
suppose to have lived longer, the enlargement of the
heart was still more remarkable. In one who lived
eleven days, the heart was of double the bigness, having
scarce any blood in the ventricles, whose cavities were
filled each with a large polypus, that on the right side
having dilated the auricle to the breadth of four inches.
The liver also was larger than ordinary, and the gall-bladder
full of a black and green bile. The appearances
were much the same in all the rest, but, as the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
they sustained the disease is not mentioned, we cannot
determine whether the enlargement of the heart took
place at the very first, or was only an adventitious symptom
after the fever had come on. Dr. Russel takes
notice that such patients as he attended complained
greatly of their heart. “A sense of oppression about the
præcordia (says he) which the sick were at a loss to
describe, was, in one degree or other, a constant attendant
on the plague, except in very slight cases of
infection; and where it came on early, or persisted in
a high degree, was always a dangerous symptom.
The sick showed how severely they suffered by their
perpetually changing their posture, in hopes of relief;
but, when asked where their pain lay, they either answered
hastily they could not tell, or, with a fixed, wild
look, exclaimed <i>kulbi! kulbi!</i> (my heart! my heart!)
This anxiety increasing as the disease advanced, terminated
at length in mortal inquietude, the patient,
for many hours, in the last stages, incessantly writhing
his body and limbs as if in agony. Though pain at
the heart was often conjoined with the symptom just
mentioned, and by the sick seemingly blended together,
it appeared to be different, and to exist separately.
They often exclaimed as in the other, my heart! my
heart! pointing also towards the scrobiculum cordis,
but then would add <i>eujani kulbi</i>, my heart pains me;
or <i>naar fi kulbi</i>, my heart is on fire.” This last pain
the Doctor supposes might have its seat in the upper orifice
of the stomach; the extreme anxiety may be accounted
for from the enlargement of the heart; but as
neither of these symptoms took place in such as died in
a very short time, we must be apt to consider this enlargement
not as any primary and essential symptom of the
disease, but as one which takes place when the vital powers
are able to oppose for some considerable time the cause
of the disease.</p>

<p>In his account of the origin of the plague, Dr. Russel
takes notice of the opinion that, at the communication
of the infection, the sick were sometimes sensible of
having received it. This has been observed by Dr. Lind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
in malignant fevers; it has also been observed in plagues,
as we have seen from Dr. Hodges, Verdoni, and others;
but Russel says he never saw any instance of this. He
owns, however, that he has seen instances of the disease
quickly succeeding a panic fear of being infested. “In
cases (says he) where the disease was not discovered to
be the plague, till upon the eruption of buboes after
two or three days, I have known several persons who
had, till then, without the least suspicion, frequented
the sick, struck suddenly with a panic, and imagine
themselves ill. They felt shooting pains in their
groins, confusion in the head, and a loathing. Though
in some these complaints were merely imaginary, and
soon vanished, in others they proved real; the symptoms
increasing, and being followed by eruptions. In
such cases I suspected the latent infection to have
been excited by terror.”</p>

<p>In the instance formerly quoted from Dr. Guthrie at
Petersburg, we have a notable example of this sudden
seizure by a stroke. His information was derived from
the physician-general of the Russian army. This gentleman
assured him, that “he had seen men, in apparent
good health, instantaneously drop down, as if shot
by a musket ball, by the sudden action of the pestiferous
miasma, and upon duty again in 24 hours, perfectly
recovered by the operation of a strong vomit.”
Whether or not these men <i>felt</i> any stroke at the instant
of their falling we are not told: possibly it might be
only a syncope very common in the plague, which took
place at the very first invasion. Russel informs us, that
“the sudden loss of strength, and disturbance of the
functions attributed to the brain and heart, are reckoned,
in a particular manner, symptoms of the plague.
In their highest degree they distinguish the most fatal
forms of the disease; and, under different modifications,
adhere to all its varieties.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The early appearance
of faintness was very remarkable in the
plague,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the plague attacks without fever in
two different modes; one, by attacking and destroying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
the solid parts of the body, the other, without any disorganization
of the body, attacking the vital principle
itself, or rather the blood, from which this principle is
derived, so that a temporary suspension of all the functions
ensues. The analogy between the cause of pestilence
and those visible substances called <i>poisons</i>, is very remarkable
in some things, though in others it totally fails.
In the Medical <span class="nowrap">Repository<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> we have a dissertation upon
this analogy by Dr. Edward Miller. He observes, that
this analogy has been generally overlooked, chiefly on
account of the invisible nature of the aerial poison, and
the suddenness of death from poisons, more frequently
than from pestilential diseases. This he accounts for
from the largeness of the dose of poisons compared with
that of contagion; “but (says he) by diminishing the
quantity to an appropriate amount, these noxious substances
(the poisons) may be made to exhibit the
course, duration, and nearly all the phenomena, of
what is called a malignant fever. But, above all, the
attention of physicians has been diverted from this
analogy between miasmata and poisons, by the febrile
part of the character which generally belongs to pestilential
diseases, and which, in common apprehension,
is constantly connected with them. Yet these diseases
are by no means universally accompanied with what
is strictly called <i>fever</i>. There is often a degree of
virulence in the Asiatic plague, in the yellow fever,
and in all the other forms of pestilential and malignant
diseases, which altogether transcends the process of fever,
and extinguishes life in a more summary manner.
In the worst cases both of poison and pestilence, the febrile
part of the symptoms excites little attention.”</p>

<p>Our author does not say in what this virulence consists.
In the cases of those who die with the <i>tokens</i> upon
them, the cause is plainly within the body; the destroying
power acting with greatest efficacy below the skin in
the soft substance of the flesh. Where the patient is
suddenly seized in the manner described by Dr. Guthrie,
the cause seems to be something foreign to the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
suddenly inhaled, the effects being similar to those of
fixed air when drawn in by the breath, and of consequence
easily expelled by a vigorous action of the powers
of the system. Guthrie observes, that, in such cases, it
seems “as if the contagious matter existed in a very
loose state in the first passages at the beginning of the
disease.”</p>

<p>In the production of those <i>tokens</i> mentioned by Dr.
Hodges, we know that there must have existed in the
body a certain cause capable of totally destroying the
parts, and reducing them to an hard eschar, similar to
that produced by fire or by a caustic. As we are unacquainted
with any thing capable of producing this effect
but fire, we can attribute the origin of these tokens to
nothing else but the emission of the latent heat of both
the solids and fluids which compose these parts, and
their consequent transmutation into an hard, and as it
were charred, substance. That such an emission of latent
heat does in some cases take place is evident from
the production of a great quantity of sensible heat when
certain substances are mixed together. Thus, upon
mixing together oil of vitriol, oil of turpentine and
strong spirit of nitre, the whole mixture will take fire
and burn violently, though two of the ingredients, viz.
oil of vitriol and spirit of nitre, are by themselves incapable
of being inflamed. In like manner if strong spirit
of nitre be poured upon oil of cloves or sassafras, the
mixture will burst out into a violent flame. Water
poured upon quick lime occasions great heat, and seems
in great part to be converted into a solid substance;
for only a small part evaporates, and the slaked lime
falls into a powder to appearance perfectly dry, and
from which the moisture cannot be expelled without a
very violent fire. In this case Dr. Black is of opinion
that the heat comes from the water, which, as we have
already seen, contains a great quantity of it in a latent
state. But, according to his experiments, the emission
of 135 degrees of heat is sufficient to reduce water to a
state of solidity; and the heat of lime when slaking is
so much superior to this, that ships have frequently been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
set on fire by it. We must therefore either say that
water in certain circumstances can part with much more
than 135 degrees, or that the lime itself emits part of
the heat it contains. This last indeed seems to be the
more probable supposition of the two; for though
fluids contain more heat in proportion to their bulk than
solid bodies, we have no reason to suppose that the latter
contain none at all: on the contrary the experiments
formerly mentioned, especially those made by Count
Rumford, show that they are furnished with an almost
unlimited quantity.</p>

<p>The cause of the most violent kind of plague then we
must suppose to be something received into the body,
which in a certain time, probably sooner or later according
to the strength of the contagion, disposes to an
irregular emission of its heat, which coming by a kind of
explosions, or, as Dr. Hodges calls them, <i>blasts</i>, produce
those eschars which have been called <i>tokens</i>, and seem to
be no other than partial combustions, by which the parts
affected are reduced to a state of charcoal, or nearly so.</p>

<p>In assigning this cause for the most deadly kind of
plague, we must naturally ask the question, how can all
this take place without any pain? for of those who died
in this manner, many felt neither pain nor uneasiness till
within a few moments of death. This can only be
accounted for by the sudden and perfect destruction of
the parts, which did not allow time for any sensation of
pain to take place; and indeed in the application of
caustic for an issue, the patient often feels but little pain.
It is impossible to avoid perceiving a very strong connexion
between this kind of plague and the dreadful
cases of spontaneous combustion related p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_182">182</a>–186.
In the case of the priest indeed the fire seems to have
come from without, though even this cannot be ascertained
beyond a doubt; but in those who were absolutely
consumed to ashes, it seems equally probable that it may
have arisen from within; and as none of the unfortunate
persons seem to have made any noise or struggle, the
priest alone excepted, it seems probable that the first
attack had deprived them of all sensation, and that, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
the terrible ideas with which such extraordinary
occurrences must have inspired those who saw
them, the sufferers may have died without feeling any
pain. The priest seems to have felt nothing after the
first stroke.</p>

<p>Should this cause be admitted (indeed whether it is
admitted or not) we see that it is in vain to attempt to
solve the phenomena of pestilence by the doctrine of stimuli,
excitement or debility. There is no degree of stimulus,
fire exepted, which can convert part of the body
into an hard eschar, neither can it be done by any degree
of debility or exhaustion. Besides, the irregular
manner in which these eschars are scattered up and down,
shows that the cause has not acted from a regular diffusion
all over the body, but in a number of insulated
spots, between which the connexion can by no means
be traced. In all pestilential eruptions indeed the action
of fire seems to be very perceptible. Gotwald mentions
his having observed in two patients what he calls <i>papulæ
ardentes</i> “burning pimples,” which Dr. Russel supposes
to be a modification of carbuncular pustules. Gotwald
calls them also <i>fire-bladders</i>, and says that they were as
broad as a shilling, of an irregular shape, and the skin
seemed as if <i>shrivelled with fire</i>. The carbuncle itself approaches
much to the nature of the eschar, and is attended
with violent heat in the adjacent parts. Gotwald, who
gives an account of the plague at Dantzic, distinguishes
the carbuncle into four kinds, (to be afterwards described.)
Of these he says in general, that they all <i>burn</i> very
violently at first, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From all these accounts it seems plain, that in the
plague there are partial discharges of heat, from <i>some</i>
cause, upon various parts of the body; and that, in many
instances, this heat destroys the texture of the parts
entirely. When this is done instantaneosly the patient
feels no pain, but if more gradually, the pain is excessive,
as in the case of buboes and carbuncles; which the
Journalist of the plague year in London informs us
were attended with such horrid pain as to make the patients
cry out in a lamentable manner. This extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
heat must either come from without or within, and
we have all the reason in the world to believe that it
comes from within. Mr. Hunter, in his Treatise on the
Blood, informs us that in a local inflammation there is
always an increase of heat in the inflamed part. Should
this heat arise, as it probably does, from an emission of
part of the latent heat, we may conclude, that such a
quantity might be emitted, as entirely to change the
texture of the parts. Thus mortifications or destructions
of those parts may ensue, of all kinds, from the
mild <i>pus</i> to the pestilential eschar.</p>

<p>In the effects of pestilential contagion we observe, if
not a <i>superiority</i>, at least a <i>different mode of action</i> from
what takes place in poisons. All these seem to act by
dissolving the blood, or infecting it in such a manner that
it supplies no sufficient quantity of animal spirits; of
consequence, the creature soon faints and dies. In the
plague, the blood does not appear to be much affected,
nevertheless it emits, in various places, certain explosions
which convert the parts into an eschar. Poisons always
seem to produce the petechiæ or purple spots which
sometimes appear in the plague. In Dr. Miller’s Treatise,
already quoted, we find, among the symptoms occasioned
by arsenic, “red or dark spots appearing on the
skin, and rapid putrefaction, which renders speedy interment
necessary.” Herein it differs from the plague,
for the bodies of such as die of that distemper are not
more liable to speedy putrefaction than others. Of the
vegetable poisons he also observes, that, “after death,
sometimes before, livid spots are observed on the body,
the appearance of the blood is dark and dissolved, and
putrefaction speedily takes place.” Of animal poisons&mdash;“The
bite of the poisonous serpents is generally
followed by tumour, and livid colour of the part bitten,
extravasation of dark coloured blood into the adjacent
cellular membrane, nausea and vomiting, sudden
prostration of strength, paralysis of the limbs, convulsions,
yellowness of the skin, hæmorrhages, &amp;c.
Livid appearances of the body, a dark coloured and
dissolved state of the blood, and a rapid putrefaction,
are observed after death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>From all these accounts, however, it is plain, that,
whatever may be the analogy between the action of poisons
and malignant fevers, they do not in any manner
operate like the contagion of the true pestilence. Of
this the constant effect is to produce buboes, carbuncles,
and other eruptions, resembling much more the effects
of fire than any thing else; or, if the patient is cut off
without the appearance of these, similar effects are observed
on the internal and vital parts. Dr. Miller’s conclusion
seems therefore liable to exception; in which he
says, “that only the lighter cases of pestilence are unlike
the effects of poison, but that, in proportion to the degree
of malignity, the resemblance grows stronger.”
It doth not appear that any poison hath produced one of
the characteristic symptoms of the true plague, or any
thing but what is common to animals dying of various
diseases, the red spots on the skin only excepted.</p>

<p>In the eighth volume of the Philosophical Transactions
abridged by Martyn, we have an account of a number
of experiments by M. Deidier and others, made upon
dogs into whose veins he injected, or poured into wounds
made in the miserable animals, the bile of people dead of
the plague at Marseilles. “The consequence was,
that they became melancholy, drowsy, and without
caring to eat. All of them died in three or four days,
with the essential marks of the true plague, declared
by buboes, carbuncles, and gangrenous inflammations
in the viscera, in the same manner as in the human
carcases from whence the bile was taken.”</p>

<p>The poisonous bile affected the creatures differently
according to the vicinity of the place of injection to the
heart. In the jugular vein it killed them in twenty-four
hours, injected in the quantity of a drachm to two
ounces of water. In this short time were brought on
gangrenous inflammations, the heart was stuffed with
<i>thick and black</i> blood, the liver was swelled, and the
gall-bladder full of green bile. This shows a very essential
difference between the action of the pestilential
poison and that of others; the former, in some parts of
the body at least, coagulates the blood; the latter, in
all parts, dissolves it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>In the crural vein (the vein of the leg) the effects
were less violent. In about an hour they became heavy.
In the former case they instantly became drowsy. In
the second experiment they contracted such a loathing
for food, that they would neither eat nor drink any
thing after the injection was made. On the third day
there appeared considerable tumours under the <i>axilla</i>
(the fore leg I suppose) and on their thighs, about three
inches from the wound. The wound itself turned
to a gangrene, and the creatures died usually on the
fourth day.</p>

<p>In another experiment the animal had convulsive
motions all over immediately after the injection, followed
by a lethargy. Next day a carbuncle appeared on the
great pectoral muscle on the right side. On the third,
a bubo appeared on the thigh, and the same day the dog
died. From the time of the injection he had neither
eat nor drank. On dissection the fore part of the breast
under the teguments was found entirely gangrened,
the inward parts and viscera full of black clotted blood,
the outward surface of the lungs was all purple, the heart
was swelled as big again as usual, and the four cavities
were full of black clotted blood. The bile of this dog,
injected into the crural vein of another, produced similar
symptoms, only the latter eat a little boiled meat,
which he vomited up again in two hours. He died the
third day, with the same symptoms of the plague as
the others.</p>

<p>The bile of people who died of ordinary malignant fevers
was much less powerful. A quantity (not mentioned
how much, but probably a drachm) mixed with four
ounces of warm water, was partly injected into the jugular
vein of a dog, and a compress soaked in the rest
of the liquor applied to the wound. He appeared heavy
and sleepy, and would neither eat nor drink till the third
day, when he did both willingly. On the fourth day
the compress fell off, the wound was found to be diminished
one half, and healed by degrees, the dog recovering
perfectly. In another experiment with the bile of
a patient who had died of a malignant fever, the dog not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
only had about a drachm of it put into a wound in his
thigh, but was made to swallow some of it; notwithstanding
which he was not seized with any distemper,
and the wound healed in fifteen days. This bile was as
black as ink, in great quantity, and very thick. In the
other subjects it was of a deep green. In another experiment,
with the same bile applied on a compress, the
dog likewise escaped without any apparent disorder;
but in a third, the animal died in twenty-three hours,
though at first he had shown no sign of being affected,
only that he seemed to be thirsty, and drank with greediness.
On opening him his heart was found still to
beat with violence, and, after the beating ceased, no
blood was to be found in it, either in the auricles or
ventricles. “This liquor, crowded together in the great
vessels, appeared of a lively red, and very fluid, without
any of those concretions that we constantly observed
in those who died of the plague. Here appeared
neither external nor internal marks of the
plague.” The bile of a person who had died of an
erysipelas, injected into the crural vein of a dog, produced
no bad effect. A dog was killed by half a drachm
of Hungarian or blue vitriol injected into the jugular
vein. He died in universal convulsions: the heart was
full of grumous blood, reduced to a kind of thick pap, but
without any clots. The bile, applied to two wounds
in another dog, produced no bad effect.</p>

<p>From other experiments it appeared that even the
pestilential poison itself, taken into the stomach of dogs,
did not produce any deleterious effects. “A dog of
the Hospital of the <i>Mail</i> in Marseilles, who followed
the surgeons when they went to dress the sick, used
greedily to swallow the corrupted glands, and the
dressings charged with pus which they used to take off
the plague sores: he licked up the blood that he found
spilt on the ground in the infirmary; and this he did
for three months, being always gay, brisk, well, full
of play, and familiar with all comers.” The health and
briskness of this unfortunate dog proved his ruin, by
making him the subject of philosophical experiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
A drachm of the pestiferous bile injected into the crural
vein, killed him in four days. He had a considerable
hæmorrhage from the wound the night before he died,
and he had also a disagreeable smell both while living
and after he was dead. Two other dogs, which had
swallowed a quantity of pestiferous bile, became heavy
and melancholy, refused their food, and showed other
signs of disorder; but all these went off in a short time,
and no signs of the distemper appeared.</p>

<p>These experiments induced M. Deidier to suppose
that the contagion of the plague lay only in the bile;
but the following experiment shows that the blood was
equally infected, and capable of communicating the
disease, and that of the most malignant species. It was
made by M. Couzier, physician to the infirmary at Alais,
and in the Philosophical Transactions we have the
following account: “I took a quantity of blood from
a person dead of the plague, and mixed it with warm
water, which mixture I attempted to inject into the
crural vein of a dog, but the end of the syringe being
too large to enter the vein, the experiment did not succeed.
This made me resolve to try to lay some of the
same infected blood upon the wound. This I accordingly
did, and covered it with a dressing, which the
dog got off in the night. I found the next morning
that the dog had licked the wound, and that he refused
his food. Towards night he began to bemoan
himself, and gave signs of an approaching death. The
next morning I found him dead, the wound being considerably
swelled and gangrened, and the edges round
the swelling were likewise gangrened.</p>

<p>“Upon opening the body, we found the liver something
larger than usual, with spots of a livid purple, as
in the bodies of persons dead of the plague. In the
stomach was found a quantity of black coagulated
blood, of the size of a hen’s egg. This in all likelihood
was what he had swallowed upon licking the
wound. The heart was very large, with a black grumous
blood in the ventricles, and the auricles were
turned blackish and gangrenous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>This last experiment naturally brings to remembrance
those of Dr. Home at Edinburgh, in which he inoculated
the measles by means of the blood of patients ill
of that disorder. From the accounts he has given in his
treatise entitled Medical Facts and Observations, we can
have little doubt that <i>his</i> experiments succeeded, however
others may have failed. One thing, however, is very
obvious, viz. that if we mean to communicate a disease
by means of the blood, we must use a much greater
quantity than if we make the experiment with the matter
of an abscess. The case of contagious diseases seems
to be the same as in fermenting liquors. With a small
quantity of yeast we can easily induce fermentation in any
proper liquor, but, if we skim off the yeast, and use only
the pure fermenting liquor, we must use a much greater
quantity; and to inattention to this circumstance we
may with probability ascribe the difficulty which Dr.
Home himself met with in introducing the disease, and
the total want of success in others. In M. Couzier’s experiment
a considerable quantity must have been used,
as he says that in the dog’s stomach it equalled the size
of an hen’s egg. A much smaller quantity of matter
taken from a pestilential abscess is capable of producing
the disease in a human body, as is evident from the case
formerly quoted of that gentleman who inoculated himself
for the plague, and of which Dr. Guthrie gives the
following account: “This was Mathias Degio, one of the
surgeons of the hospital at Bucharest, a building appropriated
to the cure of the plague in the Russian army.
He, perceiving the gentlemen of his profession <i>condemned
in a manner to death, if punctual in the discharge of their duty</i> <a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
had the resolution to inoculate himself for the plague, in
the full confidence of its efficacy, and ever afterwards
found himself invulnerable, whilst his companions
around him were falling victims to its fury. He produced
the disease by inserting, with the point of a
lancet, under the epidermis of his arm, matter from a
pestiferous abscess, and followed the cold regimen observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
in the small-pox, as he had imitated its mode
of inoculation. On the fourth day of the puncture
the fever declared itself, and he, being perfectly devoid
of fear, got through the disease without feeling more
inconvenience than if it had been that which he imitated.
He drank freely of cold water, with vinegar,
or a little wine, and kept generally out of doors. This
beverage was the only thing that had the appearance
of medicine,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>From a careful attention to all these histories, it is
plain that the plague is naturally an eruptive disease, as,
in all the animals in which it was artificially brought on,
eruptions took place, provided the life of the creature
was sufficiently prolonged to allow them to come out.
Dr. Russel says, that, from his diary, he noted down
the cases of <i>two thousand seven hundred</i> patients, <i>all</i> of
whom had eruptions of one kind or other. In this it
agrees with the small-pox, which Dr. Mead justly considers
as an inferior kind of plague. In the latter,
however, the eruptions seem to resemble those called by
Dr. Hodges the <i>tokens</i>, only that the cause which produces
them is less violent in its nature; but why the
eruptions of the small-pox should be in distinct pustules,
and not one continued boil all over the body, is undoubtedly
inexplicable on any theory whatever. The
same is true of the plague. No man can explain why
the tokens, for instance, instead of being collected into
one great eschar, are dispersed into small distinct pieces;
or why, instead of buboes in the groin and armpit, or
instead of carbuncles in different parts of the body, there
should not be a single one equivalent in bulk and power
to them all. This appears similar to the phenomena of
rain, hail or snow, which fall in distinct drops, fluid or
congealed, or in flakes, instead of being equally diffused
all over the spot on which they fall. In the latter case
we say that the phenomenon is occasioned by <i>electricity</i>:
we may say the same, if we please, of the small-pox and
plague, with equal emolument.</p>

<p>From the accounts we have just now quoted, it appears
that there is between malignant fevers and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
true pestilence a very essential difference; the latter
tending to thicken the blood, the former to make it
thinner. In this respect therefore the poisons seem to
resemble malignant fevers very considerably; for M. Fontana
observed that by mixing animal poisons with blood
drawn from a vein, it was prevented from coagulating.
In the instance above related where a dog died in consequence
of bile injected into his veins from one who
died of a malignant fever, the blood was found extremely
fluid. In some who died of the hospital fever, Sir
John Pringle informs us, that suppurations had taken
place in the brain; but in the true plague the tendency
to mortification always prevailed above every thing.</p>

<p>Lastly, that the plague proceeds from too great a
quantity of heat, either emitted from the body itself, or
some how introduced into it, seems to be pretty plain
from the effect it has of augmenting the venereal appetite
to an almost inconceivable degree. This was taken
notice of in the plague of Marseilles, and indeed in many
others. Russel quotes two remarkable passages to this
purpose; one in a plague at Genoa, the other in Messina.
“Amidst so many dreadful fears and terrors, amid so many
fetid and putrefying bodies, amid the shrieks, the sighs
and the groans of the sick, what would you have
expected? That the people, struck with dread and
horror, remained sad, modest and quiet. You are
mistaken. They sung, played on instruments, danced,
intrigued, and Genoa never was seen so shameless,
debauched, and disorderly. I have said before, that
God in this plague gathered in a harvest for heaven;
but it seemed to be also a vintage for the lascivious of
of the earth. If not so, how came so many marriages
to be celebrated in the Lazaretto of Consolation, and
that so many women, without shedding a tear for the
death of their husbands, immediately entered into new
engagements? One day, in particular, five marriages
were performed, four of the bridegrooms being buriers
of the dead, and dressing themselves and their brides
in clothes stripped off from the bodies of the deceased.”
On the plague of Medina he quotes the following extract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of a letter written by a gentleman who resided in that
city during the plague in 1743. “It has always been
observed, that, after <i>every</i> plague, those who recover
are addicted in an extraordinary degree to lewdness
and incontinence, which was surprisingly visible at
Messina, and carried to such a degree of frenzy and
bestiality, that many were known to violate the bodies
of dead virgins!”</p>

<p>That an extraordinary propensity to venery may be
produced by introducing into the body a quantity of
heat, admits now of a kind of demonstration from a fact
mentioned by M. le Roy concerning phosphorus<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> This
substance is exceedingly apt to take fire on the application
of a small degree of heat, and even by slight friction.
It is now introduced into the materia medica, and is
found to be a very powerful medicine, though dangerous
on account of its inflammability, the heat and air contained
in the human stomach being sometimes sufficient
to set it on fire. The taking such a substance into the
body therefore seems not much different from taking
actual fire into it; and indeed M. le Roy mentions the
case of a woman who had taken only a single grain, and
who he says had been recovered, <i>by it</i>, from a putrid
fever, but died suddenly from some imprudence. In
this woman the whole substance of the body was found
luminous upon dissection, and the hands of the operator
continued luminous even after being washed. M. le Roy,
having taken three grains of this fiery substance, found
himself extremely incommoded by it for some hours,
and was obliged to drink great quantities of very cold
water. Next day he found his muscular powers amazingly
increased, and had an <i>almost insupportable venereal
irritation</i>. This we see was the consequence of throwing
into the body a quantity of heat from without; but if
the body itself emits that heat which it invisibly contains,
the effects must be the same as though an extraneous
quantity had been thrown into it. Neither are we
to imagine that the <i>quantity</i> of heat contained in our
bodies is small or inconsiderable; for we have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
seen that heat consists in the efflux from any substance,
of an invisible and most subtile fluid, in all directions.
When this flux is gentle, the heat is moderate, but in
proportion to the activity of the discharge, the temperature
becomes hotter and hotter, and if very violent,
the cohesion of the parts is dissolved entirely, and the
substance is said to be on fire. There is required therefore
only some cause to begin the emission of this fluid;
for as soon as this begins, the immense quantity with
which we are surrounded, will supply more in abundance<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span>
and continue so to do, as long as the original cause
subsists, or until the substance can no longer bear the
power which operates upon it.</p>

<p>From this view of the causes of the plague, and from
the facts which have been laid down concerning it, we
cannot help perceiving a very strong similarity between
the plagues mentioned in the Old Testament and those
which still exist in the world. In one of the passages
formerly quoted it is called an <i>inflammation</i>, an <i>extreme
burning</i>; and from the testimonies of different authors
above quoted, it is plain that the disease still deserves the
name bestowed upon it in the sacred writings. From
the account given of its proximate cause, it is plain that
plagues of all degrees of intensity may take place, from
absolute accension of the body, and its reduction to ashes,
to the mildest state of the disease, in which the patient
is not confined to his bed; and all this from the
single principle of emission of heat from the body itself.
It likewise appears that there may be either in the body
itself, or in the element which surrounds it, such a constitution
as will dispose that element which is the natural
and immediate preserver of our life, suddenly to attack
and destroy it, of which the case of the Italian priest
is a most remarkable instance. In other cases, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the Italian lady, and the woman at Coventry, the body
itself seems to have given out its heat, though this could
not be done without a concurrence of the surrounding
ethereal fluid. In a stage still lower, the body is partially
consumed, or rather partly charred into a kind of cinder,
as where the <i>tokens</i> are produced; and when the
cause acts with still less violence, a fever is produced.
In the Old Testament we find these different kinds of
plagues very distinctly mentioned. In some cases the offenders
died by actual fire, which either struck them
from without, or was kindled within their bodies. In
others, they seem to have died by that very deadly kind
of plague of which we have already said so much, which
kills in a few hours. This was probably the plague
which destroyed the army of Sennacherib, and this in
the tenth chapter of Isaiah is by some thought to have
been prophesied of under the title of a <i>burning like the
burning of a fire</i>.</p>

<p>Of these things I the rather take notice, as I perceive,
in a late oration, not only the doctrine of the plague being
propagated by contagion severely ridiculed, but the
scripture itself treated in a most indecent and scandalous
manner. “In the earliest ages of the world (says he)
when ignorance and superstition led men to attribute
all extraordinary phenomena to the direct agency of
supernatural beings, pestilence was supposed to be
immediately imported from heaven. This is the opinion
which appears to have prevailed among the ancient
Hebrews, and may be ranked at the head of the
catalogue of absurdities on this subject. The dominion
of prejudice over the minds of that ignorant and
obstinate people appears in this instance particularly
striking. Such was the depth of their blind bigotry
in favour of the healthfulness of the globe they inhabited,
that they would seem to have considered it as
even superior to that of the celestial regions. Hence,
unwilling to believe that their favourite earth could
give origin to an evil so dreadful as the pestilence, they
imported the seeds of this calamity from the more unhealthful
climate of heaven!!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>In this extraordinary paragraph we find the matter so
much misrepresented, that every vestige of truth is swallowed
up in it. The Hebrews believed that they were
under the immediate inspection and government of the
Deity; a doctrine which, however our author may <i>disbelieve</i>,
he cannot <i>disprove</i>. But, notwithstanding this
immediate inspection and government, the Deity never
did bring upon them any plague but by the intervention
of natural causes. The agents which he had originally
created were sufficiently able to execute his purposes.
The Creator never employed any power but what already
existed in the world, and the power that he generally
did employ was <i>fire</i>. This agent he directed to
exert its force in such degrees as he pleased, and against
whom he pleased. It is a mistake to think that miracles
were <i>immediately</i> the effects of supernatural power. They
were all accomplished by the very powers which exist in
the world at this moment, only these powers were by the
Creator at particular times directed to act in a manner
that they would not have done had they been left to the
mechanism of their own nature. When we read therefore
of people being consumed by fire from the Lord,
there was neither importation of fire from heaven nor
any where else; the element exerted its power on these
particular persons, either by lightning proceeding from the
cloud which represented the Deity, or their bodies
threw out the latent heat which they contained, and
consumed of themselves. That in cases of this kind
there was no <i>importation</i> supposed, is evident from an expression
used about bringing water from the rock. It is
not said that the water fell from the stars, or came down
with the tail of a comet, but that the rock gave out the
water which it previously contained. At the present
day the same powers exist, and sometimes produce the
same effects that they did in former times, with this difference,
that now, having no intelligent agent to interfere
with their natural mode of action, they exert their
force indiscriminately, and as the mechanism of their nature
happens to be stimulated, they destroy every thing
promiscuously before them. In all this I cannot perceive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
the smallest absurdity, or any thing but what a reasonable
man <i>may</i> indeed <i>must</i> believe, if he makes use of
his reason. As to the causes which Dr. Caldwell so much
insists upon, viz. filth and corruption, it is extremely
probable that (while the Israelites were in the wilderness)
these had no existence. By their law they were enjoined
such frequent ablutions, that their bodies must always
have been perfectly clean. Human excrements were
not allowed to lie above ground. The offals and dung
of their sacrifices were carried to a distance, and they were
expressly told, that they must not allow of any uncleanness
in their camp, lest God should turn away from them
and abhor them. Add to all this the great heat and
dryness of the desert in which they wandered, which
would quickly parch up and carry off the moisture from
any dead carcases or putrefying matters that might be
allowed to remain notwithstanding the injunctions to the
contrary. Indeed if we consider the dryness of the climate
where these people were, and that they were constantly
attended by a large stream of water, it is difficult
to conceive any situation upon earth more healthy than
that of the Jews in the wilderness. If plagues therefore
came upon them, it is difficult to say how they could
have happened according to the ordinary course of nature;
and, if not according to this, it must have been by
an alteration of it, or by miracle.</p>

<p>The plague, as has already mentioned, in its very severe
state appears most commonly in the beginning of
an epidemic season, and is neither very common nor
very infectious. The most common mode in which it
invades the patient is with the symptoms of a malignant
fever; and of cases of this kind Dr. Russel has made
up his five classes of patients, the first or deadly kind
having been already described. In his second class, the
next in malignity to the fatal kind, the disease made its
attack with a slight shivering, succeeded by fever with
giddiness, vomiting, head-ach, and sometimes looseness.
In the night the fever increased, the thirst was excessive,
and the patient, harassed by the vomiting, &amp;c. passed a
very unquiet night, frequently with delirium or coma.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Towards morning the fever abated, the sick recovered
their senses if delirium had taken place, but if coma, it
continued through the day, and the remissions were less.
Throughout the first day, and part of the second, the
pulse was full and strong, but on the second it began to
alter, and some of the characteristic signs of the disease
to appear. The principal of these was a certain muddiness
in the eyes, which sometimes took place even on the
first day. This is by our author accounted a symptom very
difficult to be described, and, though he recounts the descriptions
given by several authors, none are found adequate
to the real appearance. “It resembled (says he)
somewhat the dull, fixed eye observable in the last stage
of malignant fevers; but the dullness was different,
muddiness and lustre being strangely blended together.
It continued with little alteration in the remissions,
and even where the patient appeared sensible and
composed it did not increase in the febrile exacerbations,
but the eyes acquired a redness that added
wildness to the look, which abating or going off in
the remissions, the muddiness remained behind. It
was this which contributed chiefly in composing that
confusion of countenance which I shall not attempt
to describe, but which enabled me to pronounce with
tolerable certainty whether the disease was or was not
the plague, though not independently of other symptoms.
When this muddiness disappeared or abated,
it was constantly a favourable sign. After a critical
sign it often disappeared suddenly, but where there
was a succession of sweats, or where no visible crisis
happened, its disappearance was slow and gradual.”</p>

<p>Along with this muddiness the patient had a peculiar
confusion of countenance; the pulse quick and equal,
or low and fluttering, but rarely intermittent; the external
heat moderately feverish, at other times intense,
with irregular flushings, with pain at the heart, or oppressions
about the præcordia; burning pain at the pit
of the stomach, and incessant inquietude. When to
these symptoms were added a faltering in the tongue,
loss of speech, while the surface of the body became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
cold and damp with clammy sweat, death was inevitable.
In the evening of the second day all the symptoms
became worse; and in the morning the patient
appeared to lie quiet more from his strength being exhausted
than from any change to the better. When
the vomiting had ceased, however, there was frequently
such a remission on the third day as gave the attendants
great hopes of a favourable event; but these hopes were
always fallacious and of short duration. Sometimes
where vomiting, looseness or hæmorrhage had preceded,
the patient died on the third day: at any rate, none of
this class recovered, whether the disease was left to itself,
or treated with medicine. The appearance of buboes
was of no consequence, for they never came to maturity,
and the little advances they made neither accelerated
nor retarded the termination of the disease, which
happened sometimes on the third, but more frequently
on the fifth or sixth day.</p>

<p>The third class of patients were equally unfortunate
with the other two. “The difference between the
second and third consisted in the absence of vomiting
at the beginning, the later accession of coma and other
bad symptoms, and a slight tendency to perspiration,
which very rarely occurred in the second.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From
the second or third night the course of symptoms in
both classes varied very little, and the termination of
the disease was in both the same: it may be added
they reigned together through all the periods of the
pestilential season, but were most prevalent in its augment;
for at its height, and in its decline, they gave
place to varieties of the disease less destructive.”</p>

<p>The fourth class was the most numerous of all. Its
distinctive marks were, “the continuance of the inflammatory
or febrile symptoms with less interruption than
in the other, a pulse more constantly sustained, or soon
recovering itself when hurried in the exacerbations;
the length and vigour of the exacerbations decreasing
in the advance of the disease; and, above all, the
prevalent tendency to a favourable discharge by the
skin, with the critical sweats on the 3d, 5th, or subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Vomiting was a concomitant in
about one fourth of the sick. The fever, for the
most part, was very moderate the first night, very
rarely accompanied with delirium, and almost never
with the comatous disposition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The buboes and
carbuncles commonly made their appearance the first
day; but it was not unusual to see a successive eruption
of these in the course of the disease.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
morning sweat, on the third day, in some cases proved
completely critical, but more commonly produced
only a remission so favourable as to encourage the expectation
of a more favourable crisis on the fifth; but,
where the patient neither sweat on the third, nor a
sensible remission took place on that day, some degree
of danger was always to be apprehended.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After
the sweat on the fifth, the subsequent exacerbations
proved slighter and slighter, and the buboes for the
most part advancing favourably, little or no fever was
left remaining after the beginning of the second week,
except perhaps symptomatic heats occasioned by the
eruptions.” In this class the patients sometimes appeared
only to have a slight attack, and yet at last
were seized with mortal symptoms, while others who
deemed to be much worse at first yet happily recovered
and did well, In general the severe pestilential symptoms
did not come on till a considerable time after the attack.</p>

<p>To the fifth class our author refers all cases of slight
infection, wherein the more formidable symptoms of
pestilence never concurred, and <i>all</i> the infected recovered.
“The access here was often attended with so little apparent
disorder, that the eruptions gave the first alarm;
and the fever which came on afterwards was frequently
so slight as not to confine the sick to the house. Others
found themselves indisposed for two or three days,
but were not sensible of any febrile heat whatever.
But in this class the disease did not always invade
thus insensibly. The febrile symptoms, especially the
first three days, sometimes run pretty high; and the
fever afterward, in nocturnal exacerbations particularly,
run out to the end of the week or longer: but, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
there was no concurrence of alarming symptoms, and
the exacerbations, terminating for the most part in
sweats, gradually diminished in force after the third or
fourth night, it was not difficult in the worst cases to
foretel the event at that period, nor necessary in others
to defer the decision so long.</p>

<p>“<i>All</i> the infected had buboes or carbuncles, and very
often both eruptions concurred in the same subject.
Persons not confined by indisposition were often, by
the inguinal buboes, prevented from walking abroad.
The carbuncles constantly formed the <i>black crust</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> and
then suppurated; the buboes in one third of the sick
dispersed. The dispersion of the buboes was never
observed to be attended with bad consequences, notwithstanding
the general neglect of purging in the
decline of the disease: indeed very few had recourse
to remedies, topical applications excepted, unless perhaps
a bleeding at the beginning, where the febrile
symptoms ran high. This class was <i>nearly as numerous</i>
as the fourth, but began to predominate rather later,
and reigned most of all in the decline of the plague
in 1762.”</p>

<p>The sixth class must be omitted, as containing dubious,
anomalous and extraordinary cases. We shall
therefore proceed to consider the accounts of the plague
given by other physicians, which, without questioning
the accuracy of Dr. Patrick Russel in relating what <i>he</i>
has seen, may serve to throw some light on the subject,
by relating what <i>others</i> have seen. Dr. Alexander Russel,
in his Natural History of Aleppo, gives the following
description of it. “The distemper in itself is the
most lamentable to which mankind are liable. The
torments of heat, thirst and pain frequently unite in
some patients; an unspeakable dejection and languor
in others; and even those who escape with life do
not cease to suffer from painful and putrid ulcers, the
painful remains of the disease. The desertion of relations,
of friends, and of domestic servants, the want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
often of the common necessaries of life, and the difficulty
of procuring medical assistance, are circumstances
likewise which aggravate the miseries of the sick, and
contribute greatly to augment the general horror.</p>

<p>“But, as no disease incident to mankind is in its nature
more terrible and destructive, so none is more difficult
to observe. Its symptoms are scarcely in all respects
alike in any two persons, and even vary extremely
in the course of an hour in the same subject. The
disease, attended in the beginning with symptoms not
highly alarming, often ends fatally in a few hours;
while the most formidable attacks, by a sudden and
unexpected alteration, sometimes terminate happily.</p>

<p>“The first complaints of those seized with this distemper,
were, in general, a coldness or shivering; sickness;
a vomiting of large quantities of porraceous bile, which
often had a very offensive smell; anxiety, or an inexpressible
uneasiness about the pit of the stomach; pain
in the back or loins; an intense head-ach; uncommon
giddiness, and a sudden loss of strength. Some
were sensible of a sharp shooting pain darting at intervals
into the parotid, axillary or inguinal glands. To
these symptoms succeeded a violent fever; in which,
while the sick complained of extreme inward heat,
their skin, externally to the touch felt little hotter
than usual. Sometimes this heat became general and
intense; at other times particular parts only were affected;
but it seldom continued long in the same degree,
having several unequal remissions and exacerbations
in a day. In these exacerbations the face became
florid, but would often from a deep scarlet change to
a livid colour, like that of a person almost strangled,
and, again suddenly changing, it would assume a cadaverous
paleness. The eyes, soon losing their natural
lustre, acquired a kind of muddiness; and the countenance
of most of the sick was ghastly and confused
beyond description. The pulse the beginning was
somewhat quicker and lower, but in other respects varied
little from the natural state. Within a few hours
it commonly increased in quickness and strength, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
seldom remained the some for an hour, nay scarcely
many minutes together; incessantly varying, both as
to strength and quickness, and without any manifest
correspondence with the other febrile symptoms.</p>

<p>“In such as complained of pains darting either into
the parotids, the arm-pits, or the groins, a small hard,
deep-seated tumour, with external discoloration of
the skin, was discovered by the touch in the part, and
these were the incipient pestilential buboes.</p>

<p>“The appearances now described were those of the
distemper on the first day, till evening, when the sick
always suffered a severe exacerbation, in which the
heat both internal and external became excessive;
and, as they generally were by that time delirious, it
was often with difficulty that they would be kept
within doors; they were greatly disposed to talk, but
faltered so in their speech, that what they said was
hardly intelligible, the tongue having shared with the
other organs in the general debility. The exacerbation
lasted the most part of the night; but the heat,
delirium, and inquietude abated towards morning, and
a manifest remission took place. Some recovered their
senses entirely, some partially, and then complained of
intense head-ach, or of pains from the buboes; it was
usual in this interval also that those who had carbuncles
began to complain of <i>burning</i> pain in those <i>fiery</i>
eruptions. The morning remission was commonly of
very short duration; the rigours, anxiety and delirium
soon returning more violent than before, attended with
a strong and frequent subsultus tendinum. These febrile
symptoms did not increase regularly as the day
advanced; but went away and returned at intervals
leaving short but alarming intermissions; for each
exacerbation surpassed that which preceded it either
in violence or duration. In the evening the pulse
could hardly be counted, by reason of its depression
and quickness; the patient became comatose, and the
respiration was quick, laborious, and interrupted.
The buboes which, some hours before, seemed manifestly
to advance, often subsided, and sometimes almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
entirely disappeared; the carbuncles, mortifying
at the top, resembled a <i>great eschar made by a caustic</i>:
and at this period also livid or black spots, of
various dimensions, often were found scattered universally
on the body.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, dreadful as they seemed,
some hope of recovery still remained; for, though
many of the sick died on the third day, several had a
favourable crisis on that day, by a profuse sweat; some
struggled to the fifth day, a few to the seventh, and,
here and there one, even to the eleventh; before
any critical alteration took place. Where a copious
sweat happened on the third day, if it did not prove
perfectly critical, it at least always considerably abated
the fever; which, in that case, was generally totally
removed by a second, though less profuse sweat,
on the fifth: and then besides weakness the chief remains
of the disease consisted in the pain of the eruptions.</p>

<p>“Nothing could be predicted with respect to the
event of the disease from the manner of its invasion;
those who had the most favourable escape having been
often in the beginning attacked with as alarming
symptoms as others were who died in a few hours.
Sometimes the febrile paroxysm, which had set in
with such formidable violence, dissolved in a few
hours, and left the patient languid indeed, and weak
in an extreme degree, but free from other complaints
except the pain arising from the bubo, which from
that period increasing in size, and advancing favourably
to maturation, was, in many cases, ready to open
in twelve or fifteen days: the patient all the while,
except the first day, walking about as usual. Great
numbers happily escaped, not only in the manner just
described, but likewise where the buboes never advanced;
for these tumours, so far from coming always
to maturation in such as recovered, very often discussed
without any bad consequence. Carbuncles
often began to digest before the termination of the fever
in a critical sweat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>“All the infected had buboes, except such as expired
suddenly, or survived the first attack a few hours only.
Instances of this dreadful kind were more particularly
observed in March 1743. The sick were seized in the
usual manner; but the head-ach, vomiting, and pain
about the præcordia, increasing every moment, proved
suddenly mortal, or terminated within a few hours in fatal
convulsions.” Dr. Patrick Russel observes, that such
instances of sudden death were very rare in the plague
of 1760, 1761 and 1762; and in these they happened
only in the winter, or early in the spring. In such sudden
deaths few had any appearance of buboes; but in
general the armpits and groins, or the inside of the arms
and thighs, became livid or black, and the rest of the
body was covered with confluent petechiæ, livid pustules
being here and there interspersed: but all these appearances
were more especially observed after death.</p>

<p>In the plague of 1760, vibices as well as livid and
black spots were frequently found on the corpse, but
not constantly. They were always suspicious in conjunction
with other circumstances, but their absence
was no proof, though frequently urged as such, that the
distemper was not the plague. The vibices sometimes
appeared several hours before death, but the livid spots
seldom or never.</p>

<p>The tongue in some was quite moist, and continued
to be like that of a healthy person throughout the disease;
in others, white at first, then yellow; at last
black, and covered with a dry, foul scurf or fur. The
thirst was generally very great, but never constant; returning
at regular intervals, and never appearing to correspond
with the danger of the fever. Sometimes it
was so little that the patient could not be prevailed
upon to drink a sufficient quantity. The appearance of
the urine was equally variable, and afforded no certain
prognostic; being seldom alike in any two patients in
the same stage of the distemper, and varying in the same
patient every day. The vomiting commonly ceased
after a few hours, excepting where the sick were induced
by thirst to load their stomach, in which case it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
always returned. Sometimes the patients were costive,
in others a diarrhœa took place, but in most the discharges
were natural. No critical solution by urine or
stool seemed ever to take place. A few cases of hæmorrhages
from the nose and uterus were observed; and if
they happened after the second day, were soon followed
by a plentiful sweat, which commonly proved critical;
“a circumstance different from what has been usually
observed in the plague at other places.</p>

<p>“From the preceding account of the plague it will
readily be conceived that nothing can be more difficult
than to form any judgment or prognostic of the
event of the disease; in which, as it is justly remarked
by Morellus, our senses and our reason deceive us, the
aphorisms of Hippocrates are erroneous, and even
Hippocrates (as I am inclined to think) might have
erred in his judgment.”</p>

<p>Innumerable other histories of the distemper might be
given, but the following, it is hoped, will be sufficient,
along with what has been already detailed, to show that
the plague in former ages was the same as at this day.
In the terrible plague which broke out in the time of
Justinian, the distemper sometimes began with delirium,
and the patient instantly despaired of life; but
more generally people were surprised by the sudden
coming on of a slight fever; so slight that no danger
was apprehended either from the state of the pulse or colour
of the body. This, however, was quickly followed,
sometimes even on the same day, sometimes on the
second or third, by buboes or parotids (swellings behind
the ear) which when opened were found to contain a
black <i>coal</i>, or <i>eschar</i>, of the size of a lentil. If these
swellings suppurated kindly, the patient recovered, but
if not, a mortification ensued, and death was the consequence,
commonly on the fifth day. Black pustules or
carbuncles, covering the body, were signs of immediate
death, as was likewise a vomiting of blood in weak constitutions;
for this terminated in a mortification of the
bowels. Pregnant women generally perished, but women
were less susceptible of the infection than men;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
and young persons were in more danger than old. Many,
who recovered, lost the use of their speech, and such
were not secure from a relapse.</p>

<p>In the last plague at Moscow, the symptoms were various,
according to the persons, constitution and the weather;
in general, head-ach, giddiness, shivering, loss of
strength, slight fever, sickness and vomiting, redness of
the eyes, white and foul tongue, with a dejected countenance,
buboes and carbuncles appearing on the second or
third day, but seldom on the fourth. The buboes were
seated chiefly in the glandular parts, the armpits and
groin, but sometimes made their appearance in the neck,
cheeks, &amp;c. Sometimes these suppurated perfectly, and
then they proved beneficial, but not otherwise. Sometimes
they suddenly disappeared, after having attained
the size of walnuts; and this retrocession was always supposed
to be a sign of approaching death. Sometimes
they neither showed any sign of inflammation nor were
painful, and in such cases afforded no relief. Similar
swellings sometimes occured in the parotid glands, but
they were never equally beneficial with the buboes.
<i>Carbuncles</i> were gangrenous spots on the skin, resembling
a burn, with black, livid or red vesicles, bordered with
an inflammatory ring, and soon terminating in a hard,
black eschar. The <i>anthrax</i> is more prominent, penetrating
deeper into the adipose membrane, and attended with
more pain and inflammation. The disease was likewise
attended with petechiæ similar to those in putrid fevers,
but larger; also with vibices, which resembled the mark
of a whip, and were considered, as well as the petechiæ,
as mortal signs. No distinct account of the pulse could
be given; as, after the disease became general, physicians
did not choose to feel the pulses of their patients but
through a glove or tobacco-leaf. Worms called <i>teretes</i>
were frequently discharged both upwards and downwards.
Women with child generally suffered abortion, and were
carried off by an uterine hæmorrhage<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>
<p>According to Sydenham, the plague begins with
chilliness and shivering, like the fit of an intermittent,
succeeded in a little time by violent vomiting and oppression
at the breast, accompanied with its common
symptoms. These continue till the disease proves mortal,
or the kindly eruption of a bubo or parotis discharges
the morbific matter. Sometimes, though rarely, the
disease is not preceded by any fever; the purple spots,
which denote immediate death, coming out even while
persons are abroad about their business. But this hardly
ever happens but in the beginning of a very fatal plague,
and never while it is on the decline, or in those years
in which it is not epidemic. Sometimes swellings appear
without having been preceded either by a fever or
any other considerable symptom; but he conceives that
some slight and obscure shivering always precedes the
seizure.</p>

<p>Mariti, in his travels through Cyprus, &amp;c. says that
the plague of 1760 began with loss of appetite, pain in
the shoulders, head-ach extremely violent, delirium,
vomiting, with a most excruciating pain in that part
where the tumour by which the plague is characterised,
is about to break forth. Death often took place on the
third day, and very few lived beyond the thirteenth.</p>

<p>The Abbe’s definition of what he calls the plague, and
which seems to be the <i>pestilential bubo</i> of the physicians,
is somewhat singular. “The plague (says he) is an oblong
tumour, shaped like a pumpkin, which is at first
of a flesh colour; but it gradually becomes red, and
at length blueish; and this is a sign that the disease
is incurable. If it continues red, and a little after inclines
to yellow, it is a sign that a suppuration will
take place: the swelling is then opened, and the patient
is sometimes cured.”</p>

<p>According to our author, the symptoms of the plague
do not appear till fifteen days after the infection is received;
and this is the reason of a law which subjects to
a proof of twenty days every person suspected of being
diseased. In this plague it was observed that people of
the soundest constitutions were the most subject to it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
and the least capable of resisting it. On the other hand,
it appeared to spare weak and delicate persons, whose
cure, in case of an attack, was much less difficult. A
greater number of Moors than of any other nation were
attacked by it; and when once they were seized, their
case was absolutely desperate. Those who had recovered
from the disease were less liable to a second attack, but
were not absolutely safe. “I have known some (says
our author) who have been ill seven times, and have
died of it at last.”</p>

<p>Dr. McBride informs us that in the plague which
raged at Marseilles and the adjacent places in 1720,
people on their first seizure seemed as if intoxicated with
drink; they lost the power of their limbs entirely, and
became so dejected that they gave themselves over to
despair from the very first attack. Along with the bilious
vomitings and purgings which generally took place
on the second day, quantities of small worms like ascarides
were thrown off. The more plentiful these evacuations
were, the more salutary; for those who vomited
and purged but little sunk down, oppressed with the
disease, and died before the fourth day, covered with
livid blotches and petechiæ; those who had the largest
evacuations had also the most plentiful eruptions of buboes
and parotid abscesses. When these appeared, the
patients rose, walked about, and became remarkably
hungry; the heat and thirst subsided, but the face continued
pale and languid, the pulse hard and frequent.
On the sixth, seventh, or eighth day, if the suppuration
stopped, and the humours went back, then came on oppression,
difficulty of breathing, furious delirium and
convulsions, which ended in death. When carbuncles,
or biles, with mortified sloughs, appeared in different
parts of the body, either alone or accompanied with the
glandular swellings, the patients scarcely ever escaped.
In great numbers of people tumours appeared without
any previous febrile symptom, and, in a few cases, went
off by resolution; in others they continued in a schirrous
state; but it was best when the tumours came to suppuration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>These are the most remarkable symptoms of this fatal
disease, which have been recorded by the physicians of
greatest eminence who have written upon the subject.
It remains still to give some particular description
of the buboes and carbuncles, which are supposed to
constitute in a particular manner the characteristic signs
of the distemper. Of these the following account, given
by Dr. Alexander Russel, seems to be sufficiently clear
and explicit.</p>

<p>Only a very few, and such as died suddenly, were
exempted from buboes, but only about one half had
carbuncles. In the latter plagues their proportion was
still smaller; but they seldom appeared earlier than in
the months of April or May. In 1742 and 1743, the
buboes often appeared on the first commencement of the
distemper, sometimes not till twelve hours after; in a
few instances not till two or three days; but in 1744
they were sometimes the first symptoms of the disease.
The buboes were generally solitary, the inguinal and
axillary more frequent than the parotid. “The inguinal
bubo for the most part was double; that is,
two distinct glands swelled in the same groin. The superior,
which in shape somewhat resembled a small
cucumber, lay obliquely near the large vessels of the
thigh, lower than the venereal buboes are usually found,
and it was that which commonly came to suppuration;
the inferior was round, and in size much smaller. I
once met with a case in which an axillary bubo divided
in like manner into two parts, one of which got under
the pectoral muscle, the other sunk deeper into the
armpit: both grew painful and inflamed, but that in
the armpit only suppurated.”</p>

<p>The bubo was at first a small hard tumour, painful
but not inflamed externally. These indurated glands
were deeply seated, sometimes moveable, at others more
or less fixed, but always painful to the touch. Sometimes
they would increase to a considerable size in a few
hours, with intense pain, then suddenly subside; and
these changes would take place several times in twenty-four
hours. “An exacerbation of the pestilential symptoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
immediately upon the decrease of the bubo, sometimes
prompted me to imagine it owing to the retrocession
of the tumour; but this did not happen so
constantly as to make me think it was so in reality.
The buboes, as far as I could learn, never advanced
regularly to maturation till such time as a critical
sweat had carried off the fever. In ten, twelve, or
fifteen days, from the first attack, they commonly
suppurated; having been all along attended with the
usual symptoms of inflammatory tumours. But I
have known them sometimes, nay, frequently, disappear
soon after the critical sweat, and discuss completely
without any detriment to the patient. At other
times, though grown to a pretty large size, the tumour,
about the height of the disease, would sink and mortify,
without any fatal consequences; for, as soon as
the crisis was complete, the mortification stopped, and
the gangrened parts separating gradually, left a deep
ulcer, which healed without difficulty. I met with
no instance of a bubo in which fever did not either
precede or follow the eruption.”</p>

<p>On the subject of carbuncles, Dr. Patrick Russel observes,
that “there are certainly varieties in them, but
perhaps these varieties have been unnecessarily multiplied,
from the same eruption having been viewed in
different stages of its progress; for all of them sooner
or later are covered with a black eschar.” Dr. Alexander
Russel describes them as follows: “The carbuncles
were commonly protruded the second day of the
disease; and though the muscular and tendinous parts
were more especially affected, no part whatever could
be said to be free of them. The carbuncle at first resembled
an angry confluent pock in its inflammatory
stage, but was attended with intense, burning pain,
and surrounded by a circle of a deep scarlet hue, which
soon became livid. By a progress very rapid, it then
spread circularly, from the size of a silver penny to an
inch and an half, two inches, nay, even three inches,
diameter; and the supervening gangrene often penetrated
deep into the substance of the parts affected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
In such of the sick as recovered, the gangrene usually
ceased spreading on the third day; and, a day or two
after, signs of suppuration were observed at the edge of
the black crust, the separation of which, advancing
gradually, was completed rather in less time than that
of the eschar in issues made by caustic. In cases where
the patient died, I was informed (for I saw none of
those cases myself) that a quantity of ichorous matter
oozed from beneath the eschar, which remained itself
shrivelled and hard, without any favourable signs of
separation or digestion.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Alexander Russel also describes another kind of
pustule, which he says appeared in a small number of
the sick, but which his brother Dr. Patrick had no opportunity
of observing in 1760. It had no livid or discoloured
circle surrounding it, but was filled with laudable
pus; and, when dry, the crust fell off, as in the distinct
small-pox. This was looked upon as a favourable
symptom, all who had it happening to recover.</p>

<p>We have now detailed, at considerable length, the
symptoms of the plague as mentioned by authors of great
eminence. To give a detail of <i>all</i> that has been said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
upon this subject would be impossible; neither indeed
can it be thought necessary in the present treatise.
Whatever may have been omitted or too slightly mentioned
in this section, will naturally be considered when
we come to treat of the cure. It now therefore only remains
to say, whether the approach of a plague may be
known by any visible signs, so that people might in
some measure prepare themselves for the ensuing calamity.</p>

<p>Were we in possession of an accurate and authentic
history of the world, this question might be very easily
decided; but the uncertainty of ancient records, the
mutilated state of those which we do possess, the diversity
of opinions among mankind, and the unhappy disposition
to <i>misrepresent</i>, so common in all ages, render it very difficult
to say any thing upon the subject. If the theory
hinted at in this section (that plagues arise from some
commotion in the electric fluid) can be allowed to have
any foundation in nature, then it ought to follow, that
the forerunners of pestilence would be some electric
phenomena; and, from a perusal of the first and second
sections of this work, it will appear that such an opinion
is not altogether unfounded<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span></p>

<p>The appearance of immense numbers of insects has
likewise been accounted a sign of approaching pestilence;
but if we suppose their appearance to be a <i>sign</i>, we can
scarce imagine their putrefaction to have been a <i>cause</i>, of
pestilence. In the east we are informed by Dr. Russel
that the inhabitants of Aleppo account the appearance of
insects, and even <i>eclipses</i>, as presages of the plague. They
suppose also that the stillness of frogs is a sign of pestilence;
but the same author informs us that all these
signs failed in 1760. Violent earthquakes and famines
seem to be more certain signs, though even these are
not always to be depended upon; it being evident
from historical accounts that pestilence has sometimes
preceded, and sometimes followed, earthquake and famine.
Mr. Gibbon, however, ascribes to the above-mentioned
causes, viz. insects, earthquakes, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
<i>comets</i>, the dreadful plague which took place in the
reign of Justinian. At least, all these preceded it; but
perhaps the <i>insects</i> were only meant to be accounted the
cause of the plague. The cause of the <i>insects</i> must remain
in obscurity. According to him, “In a damp but
stagnating air, this African fever is generated from
the putrefaction of animal substances, and especially
from the swarms of locusts, not less destructive to
mankind in their death than in their lives.”</p>

<p>This dreadful plague was preceded by comets and
most violent earthquakes. A remarkable comet appeared
in 536, supposed to be the great one observed by Sir
Isaac Newton in 1680. This, we are told by astronomers,
revolves round the sun in a period of 575 years;
but the failure of astronomical predictions in the return
of the expected comets of 1759 and 1789, shew the
futility of such calculations. Another comet appeared
in 539, and these comets were attended with an
extraordinary paleness of the sun. Mr. Gibbon observes,
that earthquakes, which he calls a fever of the earth,
“raged with uncommon violence during the reign of
Justinian. Each year is marked by the repetition of
earthquakes of such character, that Constantinople has
been shaken above forty days; of such extent, that
the shock has been communicated to the whole surface
of the globe, or at least of the Roman empire.
An impulsive or vibrating motion was felt; enormous
chasms were opened, huge and heavy bodies were discharged
into the air, the sea alternately advanced and
retreated beyond its ordinary bounds, and a mountain
was torn from Liburnia, and thrown into the waves,
where it protected as a mole the new harbour of Botrys
in Phenicia.”</p>

<p>According to Dr. Sydenham the plague at London in
1665 was preceded by a very cold winter; the first continued
till spring and went off suddenly towards the end
of March. Peripneumonies, pleurisies, quinsies, and
other inflammatory disorders, then made their appearance,
along with an epidemic fever of a particular kind,
which did not yield to the remedies successful in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
epidemics. About the middle of the year the plague
began, and increased in violence till the autumnal equinox,
when it began to abate, and by the ensuing spring
was entirely gone. Our author says that the plague seldom
rages violently in England but once in thirty or
forty years; but since his time, which is upwards of a
century, no plague hath appeared. He supposes the
plague and other epidemics to depend on some secret
constitution of the air, but pretends not to say what that
constitution is. But, besides this constitution, he is of
opinion that there must be another circumstance, viz.
the receiving the effluvia or seminium from an infected
person. Thus he supposes that a single infected person
is sufficient to poison a whole country; the general mass
of atmosphere being infected by the breath of the diseased
and the effluvia of the dead bodies. “Thus (says he)
the way of propagating this dreadful disease by infection
is rendered entirely unnecessary; for though a
person be most cautiously removed from the infected,
yet the air received in by breathing will of itself be
sufficient to infect him, provided his juices be disposed
to receive the infection. I much doubt, if the disposition
of the air, though it be pestilential, is of itself
able to produce the plague; but the plague being always
in some place or other, it is conveyed by pestilential
particles, or the coming of an infected person from
some place where it rages, to an uninfected one, and
is not epidemic there, unless the constitution of the air
favours it. Otherwise I cannot conceive how it should
happen, that, when the plague rages violently in one
town in the same climate, a neighbouring one should
totally escape it, by strictly forbidding all intercourse
with the infected places; an instance of which we had
some few years ago when the plague raged with extreme
violence in most parts of Italy; and yet the
Grand Duke, by his vigilance and prudence, entirely
prevented its entering the borders of Tuscany.” As
to the nature of the disease, when once produced, Dr.
Sydenham is of opinion that it is altogether inflammatory;
for which he gives the following reasons: 1. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
colour of blood taken away that resembles that in pleuritic
and rheumatic disorders. 2. The carbuncles resemble
the mark of <i>an actual cautery</i>. 3. The buboes
are equally disposed to inflammation with any other tumours
that come to suppuration. 4. The season of the
year may be adduced in proof of this; for between spring
and summer, inflammatory disorders, as pleurisies, quinsies,
&amp;c. are common.</p>

<p>Before we put an end to this section, it may now be
proper to say a few words by way of apology for the
many apparent digressions from the subject which have
appeared in it. In the first place, then, the work being
intended for general inspection, and not merely for medical
readers, it became absolutely necessary to introduce
a number of things which for medical readers
would have been totally superfluous. It was to be supposed
that the book might come into the hands of some
who had not read any thing concerning the structure of
the body, who had not heard of any of the systems of
medicine now prevalent, or the different doctrines they
contain. It was impossible to write in an intelligible
manner for such people without giving some few hints
concerning all these subjects: the same consideration
made it necessary to enter pretty largely into the discoveries
concerning the composition of the atmosphere
and various kinds of elastic fluids, concerning heat, &amp;c.
In doing this the writer was under a necessity either to
adopt some of the doctrines he took notice of, or to
animadvert upon them. If he has ventured freely to
give his sentiments, it is not with a view to establish a
theory of his own, but to direct the attention of the
reader to those natural agents which seem to be at
present too much overlooked, principally because they
are less accessible to our senses, and of consequence less
subject to experiment, than others. If therefore in this
treatise it is suggested that the atmosphere acts on the
human body by its internal or latent heat, and by its
electricity, as well as by its other properties; if the
writer is inclined to believe that these are in fact the
most powerful parts of it; that we never can act without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
them, and that in short our life and health are in
immediate dependence upon them; I say, that none of
all these things are in opposition to any fact hitherto
discovered, either of the medical kind or any other.
On the other hand, in all ages physicians have sought
for some constitution in the air, inexplicable, and perpetually
unknown, to which diseases might be ascribed
that could not be supposed to originate from any of its
ordinary properties. To explore this constitution is as
great a desideratum at the present moment as two thousand
years ago; and any attempt to investigate it, or a
conjecture relating to it, cannot be supposed inconsistent
with any thing already discovered and ascertained.
There are many things which lead us to think that
electricity is very much concerned in diseases, and
among the rest we must account the new discovery
of Dr. Perkins’s metallic conductors a very notable
proof of it. These, when first ushered into the world,
were made by many a subject of ridicule; but the evidence
in favour of their efficacy, both in America and
in various parts of Europe, seems now to be decisive in
their favour; and, if they act at all, it is almost impossible
to suggest any other principle than that of electricity
to which their efficacy can be owing. No doubt
it is difficult to draw the line properly betwixt credulity
and skepticism, but where credible testimony determines
any thing to have actually happened, or where solid reasoning
gives room to suppose any thing to be probable,
it never can be invalidated by any argument <i>a priori</i>
formed against the <i>possibility</i> of such a thing taking place.</p>

<p>In page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_128">128</a> it is said, that M. Lavoisier, by introducing
the new chemical nomenclature, “has entailed the
greatest curse upon the science it ever met with.” All
apology for this bold assertion is absolutely necessary,
and the quotation made from Dr. Ferriar may be deemed
inadequate, or perhaps misapplied. In passing this
censure on the nomenclature I wrote from experience.
The new nomenclature, instead of promoting <i>my</i> improvement
in chemistry, hath had a direct contrary tendency.
An instance of the inconvenience and ambiguity arising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
from it is given p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_135">135</a>, when speaking of Dr. Girtanner’s
theory. But a much more remarkable example is
to be met with in the review of Dr. Monro’s Chemical
Treatise, where we find him censured for the very
same ambiguity taken notice of with regard to Dr. Girtanner.
“He might have observed (say the reviewers)
the distinction between the hydrogen and inflammable
air, and between the oxygen and pure air, as well
as between the azote and impure air: he has mentioned
these as synonimous, whereas they are terms
that express bases, or substances in a concrete state
(what I have called the condensable part) and the compounds
of these substances and heat, when they assume
the form of gases or elastic fluids.” (Monthly
Rev. for 1790, p.&nbsp;26.)</p>

<p>That the terms invented by Lavoisier and others have
not been received with perfect unanimity by the chemists
of the present day, is evident from Dr. Pearson’s
“Translation of the New Chemical Nomenclature,”
which is not only a <i>translation</i>, but a <i>vindication</i> of it. In
the course of his work he quotes the translator of the
Chemical Dictionary saying, that, “from the zeal of
reforming language, such a number of reformers may
arise, that our ears will not be less stunned, nor our
understandings less perplexed, than if we were exposed
to the clamour of Babel, or the <i>thaw of words</i> of
Sir John Mandeville.” To this Dr. Pearson replies,
that there is no reason to fear any such bad consequences.
“The distinguished superiority of a system produced by
a <i>De Guyton</i>, a <i>Lavoisier</i>, or a <i>Bergman</i>, would surely
supercede the work of persons of <i>inferior ability</i>.” It
is impossible to know the persons here designated, unless
the Doctor points them out. If he chooses to call <i>himself</i>
one of them, we can have no objection. He certainly
has dissented, in one article, from “the system
produced by De Guyton, Lavoisier and Bergman,” and
this is with regard to the word <i>azote</i>. This is the term
announced to us as the most proper for denoting a certain
kind of air. But Dr. Pearson determines <i>nitrogen</i> to be
more proper. Even this has not given entire satisfaction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
for Dr. Mitchell has adopted the word <i>septon</i> in
preference to both <i>azote</i> and <i>nitrogen</i>. Thus, instead of
the original phrase <i>phlogisticated air</i>, used by Dr. Priestley,
we have four; for as long as the works of Dr. Priestley
remain, the original term will be used by some, while
with others it will be so much disused that perhaps they
will not understand it when it happens to occur. Nor
are corrections of this kind all that we have to fear. Professor
Wiegleb, who has written a System of Chemistry
in quarto, has therein changed almost all the nomenclature
invented by Lavoisier. Instead of it he gives a nomenclature
of his own, in which he makes very much
use of the termination <i>cratia</i>, from a Greek word signifying
strength; thus, instead of saying the <i>acid of fluor</i>,
we are to say <i>fluoricratia</i>. I must confess that to me
the perpetual repetition of this termination has a very
ridiculous appearance; but the misfortune is, that in
the case of nomenclatures we have no choice. We cannot
choose one and reject another: good or bad, we
must take both; and were an hundred new ones to arise,
we must be condemned to learn them all. Nor is even
this the worst. Wiegleb’s scholars, for instance, accustomed
to the language of their teacher, will be apt to
put it into their writings, perhaps without proper explanation;
and thus such writings must be unintelligible
both to old and new chemists: and thus it will be with
as many others as choose to invent new chemical terms.</p>

<p>Were this a proper place for entering into a discussion
of Lavoisier’s nomenclature, it might easily be shown
that the terms are not more proper than those which
preceded them; but no real inconvenience can arise from
the propriety or impropriety of a mere name. It is the
<i>resemblance</i> of the terms to one another, and the facility
with which mistakes may be made, that gives just ground
of complaint. Nor is it any just reason to accuse a person
of want of judgment or carelessness because he hath
mistaken these terms. We see that even Dr. Monro has
not attended to every circumstance; and if a man of
his experience and accuracy hath been inaccurate in this
respect, what is to be expected from others? How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
easily may the words <i>sulfate</i>, <i>sulfite</i>, <i>sulphuret</i> and <i>sulphure</i>,
be mistaken for one another, either in writing or conversation!
Yet a mistake of this kind would totally
pervert the meaning of the person who used it. The
scripture finds fault with those who make people offenders
for a <i>word</i>; but here we are in danger of being
made offenders for a <i>letter</i>. In short, taking into account
the inconveniences arising from this nomenclature
itself, the numberless corrections and amendments
(no matter whether real or imaginary) to which it may
be subjected, and the number of others totally different
from it which may arise, I cannot help looking upon
the introduction of it into chemistry as an evil of the
first magnitude; an evil which cannot be remedied by
any art, but must continually become worse and worse.</p>

<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Of the best Methods of Preventing the Plague.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">T<span class="ls01em">HESE</span> methods may be classed in the following
manner: 1. Those most proper for avoiding
the infection, supposing the disease to be infectious.
2. The proper mode of resisting or removing those local
causes which may give rise to it, or may co-operate with
the infectious matter in giving greater force to the disease,
should it happen to be introduced; and, 3. The
best method of preparing the body for resisting pestilential
attacks, should we happen to be so situated that no
external method of defence could be used.</p>

<p>With regard to the first of these intentions the flying
from places infected has been so universally recommended,
and so generally received, that the precept has been
made up into the following proverbial Latin distich:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Hæc tria tabificam tollunt adverbia pestem<br />
Mox, longe, tarde, cede, recede, redi.”</p>

<p><i>These words prevent the plague’s infectious pain,<br />
Go</i> quick, <i>fly</i> far, <i>and</i> slow <i>return again.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>This maxim hath been put in execution in all ages,
but often with so little regard to humanity that it cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
by any means be recommended without very considerable
limitation. The reparation of the sick from all
promiscous intercourse with the sound, in times of pestilence,
seems to be dictated by common sense; but this
may be done without killing them, or leaving them to
expire in the miserable state to which they are reduced by
the disease. Mr. Howard informs us that in some places
ships which have the plague on board are chased away and
burnt; and instances of cruelty with regard to infested
individuals have been formerly mentioned. Dr. Mertens
is of opinion that cutting off all the communication
between the infected and healthy is the only means
of preventing the disease from spreading. The good of
this practice was observed in one of the hospitals at Moscow.
All the avenues to it were shut up, but one which
was strictly guarded, and every suspected article prohibited
from entering. Infected clothes and utensils were
burned, and the houses where the sick had lived were
purified by the fumes of vinegar and gun-powder.</p>

<p>In this mode of prevention it is of the utmost consequence
to ascertain the distance to which the contagion
extends; in the next place to know whether by means
of clothes, cotton or other kinds of merchandise it may
be imported from one place to another; and in the third
place how long the infection may remain in these kinds
of goods; so that people may know when the danger is
over. As to the distance, it seems to be generally agreed,
that it is but small. Some of the answers to Mr. Howard
by the physicians of whom he inquired, have been
already related. Of the infection of the plague he speaks
in the following manner:</p>

<p>“In my opinion this distemper is not generally to be
taken by the touch, any more than the gaol-fever or
small-pox; but either by inoculation, or by taking
in with the breath the putrid effluvia which hover
round the infected body; and which, when admitted,
set the whole mass of blood into fermentation, and
sometimes so suddenly and violently as to destroy its
whole texture, and to produce putrefaction and death
in 48 hours. Those effluvia are capable of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
carried from one place to another, upon any substance
where what is called <i>scent</i> can lodge; as upon wool,
cotton, &amp;c. and in the same manner that the smell of
tobaco is carried from one place to another.</p>

<p>“The infection in the air does not extend far from
the infected object, but lurks chiefly (like that near
carrion) to the leeward of it. I am so assured of this,
that I have not scrupled going, in the open air, to
windward of a person ill of the plague to feel his pulse.
The rich are less liable to the plague than the poor,
both because they are more careful to avoid infection,
and have more large and airy apartments, and because
they are more cleanly, and live on better food, and
plenty of vegetables; and this I suppose is the reason
why Protestants are less liable to this distemper than
Catholics during their times of fasting, and likewise
why the generality of Europeans are less liable to it
than the Greeks, and particularly Jews.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable that, when the corpse is cold of a person
dead of the plague, it does not infect the air by
any noxious exhalations. This is so much believed
in Turky, that the people there are not afraid to handle
such corpses. The governor of the French hospital
at Smyrna told me, that, in the last dreadful
plague there, his house was rendered almost intolerable
by an offensive scent; especially if he opened any of
those windows which looked towards the great burying-ground,
where numbers every day were left unburied;
but that it had no effect on the health of himself or
family.”</p>

<p>It is likewise a matter of the utmost importance to
ascertain the time at which the disease is introduced into
any town or district. Dr. Canestrinus, in a treatise on
this distemper, published at Saltzburg, complains greatly
of the dissensions among physicians concerning the nature
of the distemper, owing to which its existence is
frequently denied, and thus its ravages are propagated
immensely beyond the limits which might otherwise
circumscribe them. Of this he gives the following remarkable
instance: “In the year 1770 a disease with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
uncommon symptoms prevailed at Bodrogh in Upper
Hungary, which carried off a number of persons
in a short time. A physician of the county of Zemplin
was sent to inquire into the nature of the malady.
He reported that the disease was of a suspicious nature,
having a great resemblance to the plague. His
report was received by the nobility and health-officers
with indignation, as if untrue. Another was sent,
who, without hesitation, pronounced the disease an
epidemic scurvy. In the mean time the disease, being
left to itself, spread wider, and raged with such
violence as to carry off seventeen persons in one house.
The nature of the disease now becoming apparent,
proper measures were taken, and the infected separated
from the sound, by which means the disease was
confined within a small district<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span>” With regard to
the infection of the disease, or <i>contagion</i>, as it is commonly
called, he expresses himself as follows: “The air
is not capable of diffusing the contagion to any considerable
distance from the infected subject unimpaired
in its power, but, like other poisonous matter, it is
capable of dilution in the atmosphere, so as to be
rendered at length innoxious. The contagion of the
plague will be entirely prevented from spreading if all
access to, and all intercourse with, the sick be strictly
prohibited: whence the following forms a safe and
infallible prophylactic of the disease:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Mox, longe, tarde, cede, recede, redi.<br />
<i>Go</i> quick, <i>fly</i> far, <i>and</i> slow <i>return again.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>“No change in the habit takes place previous to the
action of the contagion, but the body is from the first
equally susceptible of it as of the itch, or any other
infectious disease. Whilst the plague ceases in the
civilized parts of Europe spontaneously, or by human
precautions, its revival is prevented, from the care that
is bestowed in purifying or destroying every infected
substance. In the east, on the contrary, this precaution
is totally neglected; whence it is probable that
the disease is not reproduced anew, but that it is perpetuated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
by the former fomes, as happens with us in
the small-pox. The matter producing the ordinary
epidemics is widely diffused in the atmosphere, and
capable of infecting through a widely extended space.
The pestilential poison, on the contrary, is confined to
the vicinity of the affected body, and becomes so dilute
at the distance of a few paces only as to be incapable of
further action. Hence it appears that the plague is
much easier avoided than epidemic disorders. The
more abundant the contagious matter is, the further
probably is the power of its infection carried. This
is the reason that the mere separation of the sick and
suspected from the healthy is so much more efficacious
in destroying it at its commencement than at a later
period. To restrain epidemics within bounds is impossible;
but with the contagion of the plague, it is certain
that it can be confined by art to a narrow spot.”</p>

<p>Of the truth of this last assertion our author gives a
remarkable, instance in his own practice about the time
that the plague stopped at Bodrogh. Having been
sent into Cassovia, along with two other physicians, they
were informed by the surgeon of the lazaretto, that an
unusual disease had broken out in the district of Zboina,
which had suddenly proved fatal to many. On inquiry
it was found that it had come from Bodrogh in the
following manner: Two young men, returning from
the vintage at Tokay, slept a night in an infected house,
and stole some clothes belonging to those who had died
of the plague. He who carried the clothes died by the
way: his father carried home the bundle, kept them
unpacked for some weeks, but having at last worn them,
he and all his family fell victims to the same disease.
The pestilence began to spread, and shewed an appearance
of great malignity. Our author did not hesitate
to declare its true nature, and in consequence of his
declaration all communication was cut off between the
adjacent countries and the infected spot, by a cordon of
the military. The infected were separated from such as
were only suspected, and these last from the sound:
three infected houses were destroyed by fire, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
means (to be afterwards related) were used with a view
to destroy the contagion itself. Thus the disease was
prevented from spreading; and none but such as had
been previously suspected were seized.</p>

<p>To the same purpose the Abbe Poiret thinks it an
easy matter to extinguish the plague entirely. He was
a witness to the ravages of the disease in Barbary, and
thinks it the most easily avoided of any distemper; but
the misfortune is, that there are many things in their own
nature very easily accomplished, which the inattention
or perverseness of mankind render utterly impracticable.
Such, it is to be feared, is the extinction of the plague
by the means just mentioned; for though these means
might be enforced in a country district or small town,
yet, where the pestilence enters a large and populous city,
there are so many modes of concealing its existence, and
the unknown intercourse of the sick with the sound
must be so frequent, that it seems scarce possible to prevent
the malady from spreading.</p>

<p>In London, whether it arose from a neglect of using
the precautions for too long a time, or from any other
cause, cannot well be known; but the attempts of the
magistrates to separate the sick from the sound certainly
were not attended with any good consequence.
“The consternation (says Dr. Hodges) of those who
were thus separated from all society, unless of the infected,
was inexpressible, and the dismal apprehensions
it laid them under made them but an easier prey to the
devouring enemy. And this seclusion was on this
account much the more intolerable, because, if a fresh
person was seized in the same house but a day before
another had finished the quarantine, it was to be performed
over again; which occasioned such tedious
confinements of sick and well together, as sometimes
caused the loss of the whole. Moreover, this shutting
up of infected houses made the neighbours fly
from theirs, who might otherwise have been a help to
them on many accounts; and I verily believe that
many who were lost might have been alive, had not
the tragical mark upon their doors driven proper assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
from them. And this is confirmed by the examples
of other pestilential contagions, which have been
observed not to cease until the doors of the sick were set
open, and they had the privilege of going abroad.”
The Doctor sets forth also the arguments on the other
side; but whatever <i>might</i> have been the advantages of
a separation of the sick from the healthy, if conducted
in a manner less capable of hurting the feelings of humanity,
it is evident that in the London plague the
methods attempted to prevent the disease at least did
no good.</p>

<p>In countries where the plague generally prevails, and
the Europeans are <i>united</i> in the opinion that it is necessary
to separate themselves from the natives, the method
of shutting up is attended with the most salutary effects,
as has been attested by almost every traveller who has resided
there for any time. Accidents among them are
very rare, though not altogether without example. At
Alexandria in Egypt, M. Volney tells us, that as soon
as the plague makes its appearance the European merchants
shut themselves up in their <i>khans</i> and have no
communication with the rest of the city. Their provisions
are deposited at the gate of the khan, and received
there by the porter, who takes them up with iron tongs,
and plunges them into a barrel of water provided for the
purpose. If it is necessary to speak to any one, they
keep at such a distance as to prevent touching with their
clothes, or breathing on one another; by which means
they preserve themselves from this dreadful calamity, unless
by some accidental neglect of these precautions.
Some years ago a cat, which passed by one of the terraces
into the houses of the French merchants at Cairo, conveyed
the plague to two of them, one of whom died. This
state of imprisonment continues for three or four months,
during which time they have no other amusement than
walking in the evening on the terraces, or playing at
cards.</p>

<p>The doctrine of predestination, and still more the barbarism
of the government, have hitherto prevented the
Turks from attempting to guard against this destructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
disease: the success, however, of the precautions taken
by the French, has of late begun to make some impression
upon many of them. The Christians of the country
who traffic with the French merchants, would shut
themselves up like them; but this cannot be done
without permission from the Porte. A lazaretto was
some years ago established at Tunis; but the Turkish
police is every where so wretched, that little can be hoped
for from those establishments, notwithstanding their extreme
importance to commerce and the safety to the
Mediterranean states. The very last year afforded a
proof of this; for as violent a plague as ever was known
broke out there. It was brought by vessels coming
from Constantinople, the masters of which corrupted
the guards, and came into port without performing quarantine.
Water carriers have never been attacked by it.</p>

<p>Mariti says, that in the island of Cyprus, and on the
continent of Syria, every European, on the slighted appearance
of the plague, after taking the necessary precautions,
shuts himself up with his family. The Mahometans
alone, more intrepid, go abroad as usual, converse
with each other, give such assistance to each other as may
be necessary, and often fly to the relief of a Christian
when deserted by his friends. This arises from their belief
in predestination. The Mahometans of Syria, however,
less familiarized with this scourge, make use of
some precautions, which were augmented in 1760.
They published an ordonnance forbidding every vessel
attacked by the plague to enter their ports: but their
vigilance in this respect was so remiss, that it was not sufficient
to prevent the contagion. The governor of Acre
checked the progress of this plague, by giving the inhabitants
the means of retiring from its ravages; and these
means, though absolutely contrary to the dogmas of the
Mahometan religion, were eagerly embraced. The Europeans
became their models; and the governor, after
deriving from them every necessary information, shut
himself up, after their example, together with his numerous
family. The mufti alone, being the protector of
the Mahometan law, cannot imitate a conduct which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
that law condemns. Instead of shutting himself up in
a prudent confinement, he thundered forth against this
new method, reproached the governor for his conduct,
and, having treated him as an impious person, threatened
him with all the vengeance of Heaven. The governor,
however, only laughed at this pious folly of the mufti,
and sent a detachment of soldiers to impose on him a
fine of two hundred and fifty sequins, for having dared
to ascribe to him, in matters of religion, an ignorance,
from every suspicion of which his age ought to have secured
him.</p>

<p>In the time of plague, the proper precautions are, to
shut one’s self closely up, and to receive no provisions or
other things, except those on which the plague has no
influence. The people of Syria, however, in 1760, admitted
every kind of provisions without fear, but not
without using certain precautions. They did not receive
warm bread; flesh of every kind was thoroughly washed,
and milk was strained through a linen cloth, in order to
free it from the smallest particle of animal hair. All
kinds of pulse were soaked in water, and they abstained
from peaches, apricots, and other fruits which are covered
with a downy rind. Fowls were cooked out of the house,
for fear that some small feather might adhere to them.
Flowers were altogether proscribed. Letters were opened
by the person who brought them; and they were never
read until they had been steeped long enough in vinegar
to be purified without effacing the writing. Every
thing was received into the house by means of a rope of
herbage suspended from a window. The governor employed
every precaution which he thought likely to guard
him from the contagion; and, by shutting himself closely
up, he set an example which the rest of the Mahometans
did not neglect to follow. Besides this he caused the
streets to be cleansed; and carried his vigilance so far as
to forbid the caravans which arrived from Damascus,
where the plague swept off four or five thousand
people every day, to enter the city. He obliged them to
submit to a proof of eight days without the walls, and
established regulations of the same kind respecting vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
coming from Alexandria or Damietta. One precaution
taken in the time of plague is, to prevent <i>cats</i> from entering
houses: an open war is therefore declared against
these animals; and, wherever they are found, they are
knocked on the head with large clubs. This is a cruelty
absolutely necessary; for there is no vehicle that will
convey the infection with more certainty or rapidity than
the hair of cats. Rats and mice multiply in consequence
of their destruction; but there is no instance of
their ever having propagated the plague. This disease,
when it attacks men, spares quadrupeds and birds. The
furs of the one, and the feathers of the other, however, attract
and communicate the infection. People ought
particularly to keep from goats and sheep; from horses
and oxen little is to be apprehended.</p>

<p>All these precautions were sometimes ineffectual.
The French at Acre, who there, as well as throughout
Syria, are collected into one quarter, used every precaution
that could be thought of, yet, on the 30th of March,
1760, five of them were infected. They belonged to
the hospital of the Holy Land, and the monks were instantly
ordered to shut themselves up. They did so;
and eight of them died, one only escaping.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard likewise gives particular accounts of the
precautions used in several different countries through
which he travelled. In Malta two kinds of quarantine
are performed; one for ships with clean bills, the other
for those with foul. The former lasts 18 days<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> The
crews and passengers are allowed to buy provisions, and
converse by means of enclosures with stone posts and
palisadoes. A letter received from a Turkish ship was
taken by a pair of iron tongs, dipped in vinegar, put into
a case, and laid for about a quarter of an hour on a wire
grate under which straw and perfumes had been burnt;
after which the letter was taken out and opened by one
of the directors. In this island ships with foul bills must
perform quarantine eighty days; but, at the end of
forty, may change their station. The different kinds of
goods are separated and placed in proper order under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
cover. The cottons are taken out of the bags containing
them, and placed on rows of piles on boards, laid on
stone pillars about 18 inches from the floors; and, in
repacking them they are flung over a man who gets into
the bags, and treads down the cotton; the consequence
must be the exposing him to great danger, should
any infection remain.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard took a voyage to Venice in a ship with
a foul bill, on purpose to know every thing relative to
the performance of quarantine. “A messenger (says
he) came in a gondola to conduct me to the new
lazaretto. I was placed, with my baggage, in a boat
fastened by a cord ten feet long to another boat in
which were six rowers. When I came near the landing
place the cord was loosed, and my boat was pushed
with a pole on the shore, where I was met by the
person appointed to be my guard. Soon after unloading
the boat, the sub-prior came and showed me
my lodging; a very dirty room, full of vermin, and
without table, chair or bed. That day and the next
morning I employed a person to wash my room; but
this did not remove the offensiveness of it, or prevent
that constant head-ach which I had been used to feel
in visiting other lazarettos and some of the hospitals
in Turky. My guard sent a report of my health to
the office, and, on the representation of our consul, I
was removed to the old lazaretto. Having brought
a letter to the prior from the Venetian ambassador at
Constantinople, I hoped now to have had a comfortable
lodging. But I was not so happy. The
apartment, consisting of an upper and lower room, was
no less disagreeable and offensive than the former. I
preferred lying in the lower room, on a brick floor,
where I was almost surrounded by water. After six
days, however, the prior removed me to an apartment
in some respects better, and consisting of four rooms.
Here I had a pleasant view; but the rooms were
without furniture, very dirty, and no less offensive than
the sick wards of the worst hospital. The walls of my
chamber, not having been cleaned perhaps for half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
century, were saturated with infection. I got them
washed repeatedly with boiling water, to remove the
offensive smell, but without any effect. My appetite
failed, and I concluded I was in danger of the slow
hospital fever. I proposed whitewashing my room with
lime slaked in boiling water, but was opposed by
strong prejudices. I got this, however, done one
morning through the assistance of the British consul,
who supplied me with a <i>quarter</i> of a bushel of fresh
lime for that purpose. The consequence was, that
my room was immediately rendered so sweet and fresh,
that I was able to drink tea in it in the afternoon, and
to lie in it the following night. On the next day the
walls were dry, as well as sweet, and in a few days I
recovered my appetite. This room was lime-whited in
November, and in a very rainy season. In the following
March, in complaining to the under sheriffs in
Newgate of their inattention to the clause which orders
this in the act of parliament for securing the
health of prisoners, their excuse was, that they were
afraid of dampness.”</p>

<p>An health-office was established at Venice in 1448,
in the midst of a very destructive pestilence. The old
and new lazarettos are both built on little islands, surrounded
not only by canals, but high walls. They
have only a ground floor, and one over it, and are divided
and subdivided into a great number of apartments,
each having an open court in front, with plats of
grass, which is not suffered to grow too high; nor are
any trees suffered to grow within this district, or a good
way from it. The internal government is managed by
a prior, who must not be related to the magistracy nor
any of its ministers. He must have no interest nor concern
in shipping nor in trade. He must see all the
gates and doors of the apartments locked every evening
by sunset; he takes the keys into his possession, and
suffers them not to be opened before sunrise; and, in
case of any suspicion of infection, the gates must be kept
constantly locked, and opened only for necessary occurrences
in presence of the prior. He must not suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
dogs, cats, &amp;c. to lodge in the lazaretto. He must
neither buy nor sell, nor suffer others to do so, within the
lazaretto. No fishing boats or other small craft to come
within a certain distance, or keep communication with
those performing quarantine. Provisions are received
by poles seven or eight feet long, and the money dipped
in vinegar and salt water before it is received. The prior
and his substitute must carefully avoid touching either
goods or passengers in quarantine, and for this purpose
they keep a cane to make those who approach them
keep their proper distance; but if by an unfortunate accident
they should be contaminated, they must perform
quarantine. Any person maliciously touching them is
liable to punishment.</p>

<p>Ships are strictly forbid to use any ropes but such as
are tarred. Wool, silk, cotton-wool, woollen and linen
clothes, and furs especially, are accounted the most dangerous
goods. Animals with long hair are subject to full
quarantine; but short haired ones purged by swimming
ashore; feathered animals, by sprinkling with vinegar
till wet.</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Mead, though an enemy to the
cruel mode of abandoning the sick, or treating them
with any kind of harshness, was perfectly sensible of the
necessity of using every precaution for preventing pestilential
contagion from being imported. In his opinion
it is not sufficient that ships should perform quarantine,
“the only use of this being to observe whether any die
among them. For infection may be preserved so long
in clothes among which it is once lodged, that as
much, nay, more of it, if sickness continues in the ship,
may be brought on shore than at the beginning of the
forty days, unless a new quarantine be begun every
time any person dies; which might not end but with
the destruction of the whole ship’s crew.” He is therefore
of opinion that lazarettos ought to be established on
small islands near the sea-coast; and in this Mr. Howard
agrees with him. The latter recommends the lazaretto
at Leghorn as the best in Europe. Dr. Mead also
very much insists on the utility of destroying the clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
of the sick, because, says he, they harbour the very <i>essence
of the contagion</i>. He quotes in favour of this opinion
what Boccacio says he <i>saw</i> at Florence in 1348;
viz. that two hogs, finding in the streets the rags which
had been thrown out from off a poor man dead of the
disease, after snuffling upon them, and tearing them with
their teeth, fell into convulsions, and died in two hours.
This is one of the things which Dr. Moseley looks upon
to be incredible. It is indeed very marvellous, and
seems to be contradicted by M. Deidier’s account of the
dog at Marseilles who swallowed with impunity the filthy
pus and pestilential matter adhering to the dressings of
plague sores: but, when a person of credit informs us
that he <i>saw</i> any thing, we scarce know how to contradict
him. The evidence of pestilential contagion adhering
to clothes, does not depend on such accounts. That
lately quoted from Dr. Canestrinus is decisive on the subject;
and he informs us that one of the methods used
by himself to stop the plague in Zboina, above mentioned,
was, the burning of the clothes of infected persons. He
says that the pestilential contagion resembles that of the
small-pox, in being of a fixed nature; and that all who
studiously avoided communication with the sick, or with
whatever fomes might carry the contagion, escaped it altogether.
“That the contagion of the plague (says he)
may lie dormant for a considerable time, and be carried
to a great distance by the medium of packages, &amp;c.
and again revive with its former violence, is proved by
various circumstances. <i>Chenot</i> relates, in his treatise
on the plague which raged in Transylvania, that the
infection was revived a whole year after it had disappeared;
and other similar instances are adduced.” If
this revival happened from infected clothes or soft goods,
it shows them to be dangerous in the extreme; but of
this we have not any direct proof, neither indeed is such a
belief quite consistent with what takes place in all plagues,
viz. that the clothes of the infected are worn by the sound,
without producing any reinfection. In the great plague
at London, for instance, where an hundred thousand probably
perished, and a much greater number must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
been infected, we cannot suppose that all the clothes belonging
to such an immense multitude were burned, or
never made use of again. It is of necessity therefore
that we suppose the pestilential contagion to become
effete, and to lose its virulence, after some time; and
this seems to be very much hastened by exposure to the
atmosphere. The doing of this, however, by obliging
people to put their naked arms into bales of suspected
goods, has such an appearance of cruelty, that Dr. Mead
has proposed to judge of the presence or absence of infection
by allowing little birds to fly about among them;
“because (says he) it has been observed, in times of
the plague, that the country has been forsaken by
the birds; and those kept in houses have many of
them died.” But, though he says this upon very
great authority, no less than that of Diemerbroeck, yet
we can by no means look upon the fact to be absolutely
determined. Dr. Russel indeed says that the desertion
of the birds is looked upon by the Turks to be the <i>sign</i>
of an approaching plague; but this failed in 1760.
Thucydides says that birds of prey deserted the territory
of Athens during the great plague in his time; and he
supposes them to have been poisoned by feeding upon
the bodies of such as died of the disease. It is possible
that such food might be disagreeable to them, but no
proof is brought of any of them having been actually
poisoned by it. As for birds kept in houses, it is possible
that in a time of general calamity they might have been
neglected, and died for want of proper food, &amp;c. Dr.
Mead also quotes an instance which cannot be credited in
a consistency with undoubted testimonies that pestilential
contagion does not extend but for a very little way.
Upon opening an infected bale of wool in the field near
Cairo, “two Turks employed in the work were immediately
killed, and some birds which happened to fly
over the place dropped down dead.” Such accounts
have arisen from a supposition that the whole mass of
atmosphere was violently infected; but this would be totally
inconsistent with the life of any human creature,
and we may well put down this, as that of pestilential infection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
arising from cities like a cloud, as merely chimerical<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>
It is too well known that pestilential contagion,
instead of soaring in the air, keeps very near the ground.</p>

<p>We now come to the second mode of prevention, viz.
removing these local causes which, in the opinion of
some, may produce a plague in any country, and, in that
of others, may increase or set in action the contagion
previously existing. These causes have been enumerated
by the late Dr. Smith<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> in a Dissertation on the pestilential
Diseases which at different times appeared in the
Athenian, Carthaginian and Roman armies, in the neighbourhood
of Syracuse. They are, 1. The climate and
season. 2. The situation of the armies; and, 3. Their
condition. The climate of the island of Sicily in general
he observes is extremely pleasant at some seasons of
the year; in the neighbourhood of Syracuse particularly
storms are so infrequent during the former part of the
year, that the sun is never obscured for a whole day.
Even in the month of January, however, the weather is
warm, and as the season advances the heat becomes insupportable.
In autumn it is rendered somewhat unpleasant
and unhealthy by the frequent rains and chillness of
the evenings. But, in particular places, during the hottest
season, nothing can exceed its unhealthiness. According
to Barichten, “the least stagnant water is sufficient,
in the heats of summer, to poison the atmosphere:
its effects on the countenances of the poor
people who live in its vicinity are evident; and a
stranger who travels through the island in this season
ought to avoid ever passing a night near them.” De
Non says, that “as soon as the sun enters the Lion, this
country becomes the house of death: fevers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
most malignant kind seize on the imprudent or unfortunate
wretch that spends a night near them (ponds
and marshes) and few escape with life when attacked
by so virulent a disorder.”</p>

<p>To the poisonous effluvia of these marshes the Doctor
attributes, in an especial manner, the plagues which took
place in the armies. In the second year of the Peloponnesian
war, the Athenian army was encamped, as we
are told by Thucydides, “upon marshy and unwholesome
ground;” and that such kind of encampments will
produce diseases in an army is well known. In the time
of Dionysius, when the Carthaginian army under Imilco
suffered so dreadfully, or rather was totally destroyed,
his camp was situated on an eminence between two
morasses, the heat at that time being excessive. Hannibal,
the predecessor of Imilco, had also lost great part
of his army by a plague, though he had been encamped
in a healthy situation; but, in order to raise a wall
which should overlook the city, he had taken the materials
of the tombs found in the common burial place,
the city at that time containing two hundred thousand
inhabitants. “From the uncovering and disturbing of
so many dead bodies (says our author) arose a terrible
pestilence, which carried off immense numbers of the
Carthaginians, and amongst the rest the general himself.”
To the unhealthy situation of the armies also
the Doctor ascribes the plague which took place in the
Roman and Carthaginian camps in the time of the second
punic war; and the Carthaginians suffered most, by
reason of their being nearer to the marshes. The state
of mind, the cleanliness of the person, &amp;c. also must be
taken into account; and our author shows that neither
of these could be supposed favourable to the Carthaginians.</p>

<p>That personal cleanliness, and breathing pure air,
should contribute to the health of individuals, or to any
number of them collected into camps or cities, seems to
be agreeable to reason and common sense; nevertheless
we find that this has been denied, and even Dr. Canestrinus
says that “in the plague of Lyons and Marseilles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
it was observed, that the most populous parts of these
cities, <i>where the streets were narrow and filthy</i>, suffered
<i>less</i> from the disease than those which were more airy
and clean. At the time of the plague in London in
the time of Charles II, the physicians advised that all
the <i>privies</i> should be opened and exposed; the fetid
odour from which having pervaded the city, the plague
was stopped! Is it from this cause (the author asks)
that the plague has seldomer visited Spain, the towns
of which are intolerably offensive from their want of
cleanliness?<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span></p>

<p>This certainly seems a very strange doctrine, nevertheless
the fact that Spain is but little subject to the
plague seems undeniable, and as it is no less certain that
the towns are excessively filthy, it would seem that
cleanliness is not effectual in preventing it. But, however
agreeable the smell of human excrements may be to
the Spaniards, or to the English physicians in former
times, it seems to be less so at present. “I am persuaded
(says Dr. Ferriar) that mischief frequently arises from
a practice common in narrow back streets of leaving
the vaults of privies open. I have often observed
that fevers prevail most in houses exposed to the effluvia
of dunghills in such situations.” In Spain the
opinion seems to have been but lately eradicated; for
some years ago, an order having been issued by government
that the streets of Madrid should be kept somewhat
cleaner, the people were so much exasperated at being
threatened with the loss of the savoury odour, that a rebellion
had almost ensued, and the physicians declared the
smell of human excrements to be the most wholesome
thing in the world<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>That the confinement of human effluvia, along with
heat and want of water, will produce a malignant fever,
is certain from the example of the unfortunate people
confined in the Black Hole at Calcutta. In this case
the distemper seems to justify the opinion that plague
may be artificially produced, perhaps more than any
other upon record; for Dr. Ferriar informs us that it
was attended with eruptions resembling those of the true
plague. In this case, however, the confinement was
beyond example in any situation which can be supposed
incident to a city or camp. There is no country in the
world where the inhabitants are equally numerous with
those of the empire of China, its population at present
being estimated by Sir George Staunton at <i>three hundred
and thirty-three millions</i>, a number equal to <i>one third</i> of
the supposed inhabitants of the whole globe; of consequence
the cities must be immensely crowded with inhabitants;
yet it remains free from plagues. Human
effluvia therefore, in the most populous state in which
mankind can exist in society, <i>are not</i> able to taint the
atmosphere of a country or city. The following is Dr.
Clark’s account of that celebrated empire: “The
whole empire of China is represented to be extremely
delightful; the soil rich, the air pure, and the industry
of the inhabitants astonishing. As it produces
every luxury and necessary of life, it is justly esteemed
one of the most fertile countries in the world. As the
Chinese prohibit emigration, and seldom or never engage
in war, their country is extremely populous.
Every river maintains a proportion of inhabitants adequate
to the land, whose families live continually in
boats, without having any other place of residence.
Their number of people lays them under the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
of carrying industry to the greatest height; for
otherwise their country, fertile as it naturally is, would
be insufficient to maintain the inhabitants. Every
inch of land is cultivated; no forests nor woods, nor
even a single tree, is suffered to obstruct the labours
of the husbandman. Canals are cut every where to
water the fields, and marshes are manured for the
cultivation of rice. By these means health and plenty
are, in a great measure, the portion of its inhabitants
through all the seasons of the year. The only terrible
and fatal diseases to which they seem to be subject
are the small-pox and leprosy.”</p>

<p>But, though our author determines in general that
the air of China is pure, this cannot apply to every part
of it without exception. On the contrary he describes
in the following manner Wampoa, a village about fourteen
or sixteen miles below the city of Canton, on Canton
river: “It is the usual station of all European
ships in this river. On one side the land is low,
marshy, and covered with water, forming swamps fit
only for the cultivation of rice. The extent of these
swamps is considerable; the tide rises high, and overflows
great part of them; but the intersection of the
rivers renders them more pure than they would otherwise
be; and consequently the air is much healthier
than one could expect from the unfavourable aspect.”</p>

<p>In like manner Canton city he says “is built on a
very extensive plain, and is large and populous. Here
the government allow the English, Dutch, French,
Danes and Swedes separate factories on the banks
of the river. The city, though paved, is very wet in
rainy weather; and the water makes its way under
the factories of the different nations every tide. The
houses are built with bricks; the apartments are in
general small, and not very lofty, and the ground
stories are very damp. When the business of the season
is over, the supercargoes remove to Macao, a
Portuguese island, subject to the Chinese government.
The city of Macao is situated on a rising ground;
the whole island is dry, rocky and barren; it is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
plentifully supplied with provisions by the Chinese;
and, though the air is very sultry, yet it is tolerably
healthy.”</p>

<p>From the preceding account it is plain, that the
causes which operate in the production of plagues and
epidemic diseases in other countries, though they exist
in China, do not act there with equal efficacy. At
Wampoa the marshes in the neighbourhood must, in the
hot season, emit noxious effluvia as well as any where
else, and there can be no certainty that the overflowing
of the tide is sufficient to put a stop to their malignant
influence. At Canton the water penetrates below the
floors of the houses, and we have seen from Dr <span class="nowrap">Fordyce<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span>
that <i>in other countries</i> the sprinkling of a floor with clean
water, and the encampment of an army upon ground
where water was found at a small depth below the surface,
were sufficient to produce fevers; yet here it is not
so. In this city also the inhabitants are numerous, and
the apartments small; so that neither the perspiration of
multitudes, nor the moist exhalations from water stagnating
in the streets, nay, under the houses themselves,
are able to produce the diseases in question. Again, at
Macao the sultry heat of the air has as little effect as the
rest.</p>

<p>Lastly, in Pekin, the capital, the population and the
crowd are immense. According to Sir George Staunton<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span>
the city is about one third larger than London; but, as
he <span class="nowrap">supposes<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> it to contain three millions of inhabitants,
the population must be twice and a third-part as great as
that of London in proportion to its bulk. “The low
houses of Pekin (says he) seem scarcely sufficient for so
vast a population; but very little room is occupied by
a Chinese family, at least by the middling and lower
classes of life. In their houses there are no superfluous
apartments. A Chinese dwelling is generally surrounded
by a wall six or seven feet high. Within
this enclosure, a whole family of three generations,
with all their respective wives and children, will frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
be found. One small room is made to serve
for the individuals of each branch of the family, sleeping
in different beds, divided only by mats hanging
from the ceiling. One common room is used for
eating.”</p>

<p>Where diseases are prevalent, circumstances of the
kind just mentioned would certainly be urged as evident
<i>causes</i> of them; but in China we see that <i>something</i> disarms
such causes of their power. People, however, seldom
want a salvo for any thing. “The crowds of
people, at Pekin (says our author) do not prevent it
from being healthy. The Chinese indeed live much
in the open air, increasing or diminishing the quantity
of their apparel according to the weather. The
atmosphere is dry, and does not engender putrid diseases;
and excesses productive of them are seldom
committed.” But, if the dry air at Pekin contributes
to the health of the people, why does not the moist air
of Canton produce diseases? Besides, in this empire
there are multitudes of people who live entirely upon
the water, in a kind of houses constructed upon junks,
employed in carrying grain from place to place, or for
other purposes<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> Sir George Staunton computes the
number of inhabitants on a branch of a single river
to be no less than an hundred thousand. What then
must they be throughout the whole empire! Yet these
people, though continually exposed to moisture, as well
as to an almost inconceivably crowded situation, are yet
no more subject to epidemics than others. Our author
does not specify the <i>excesses</i> which produce disorders.
Intemperance in drinking no doubt is one of them; but
Dr. Patrick Russel expressly says, that he never saw an
instance of the plague being brought on by intemperance.</p>

<p>Lastly, with regard to living in the open air, Mr.
McLean has ascribed to the vicissitudes of this element
the principal if not the <i>only</i> cause of epidemics.
“A fact worthy of notice (says he) is, that aged persons
and children are both seldomer and less severely attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
by epidemics and pestilential disorders than
the young and middle aged, and women seldomer and
less severely than men. Now, if contagion was the
source of these diseases, the case would be exactly reversed.
Old people, women and children, being more
in the way of contagion, would be more frequently
and more severely attacked. But the young and middle
aged, being more exposed to the <i>vicissitudes of the
atmosphere</i>, the principal source of those diseases, they
are consequently more severely attacked. It has been
a puzzling question to solve why old people and children
are less exposed to plague, &amp;c. but the solution
will be no longer difficult if it should be proved that
these diseases are <i>always</i> produced by certain states or
vicissitudes of the atmosphere, together with the application
of other powers co-operating in the production
of indirect debility.” In the country we speak of,
however, this solution fails in a manner almost as evident
as can be imagined. “The removal of the embassy,
(says Sir George Staunton) was a disappointment to
several persons belonging to it, who had made arrangements
for passing the winter at Pekin. Judging of its
temperature by the latitude of the place, a few minutes
under 40° north, they were not aware of the violent
effect of the great range of high Tartarian mountains,
covered perpetually with snow, upon that capital,
where the average degree of the thermometer is under
twenty in the night during the winter months, and
even in the day time is considerably below the freezing
point. The usual inhabitants were guarded against
cold, not only by habit, but by an increase of clothing
in proportion to its intenseness, consisting of furs, woollen
clothes and quilted cottons. They are not accustomed
to the presence of fire. They have no chimneys,
except to kitchens in great hotels. Fires, on
which Englishmen chiefly depend against suffering by
the sharpness of the atmosphere, could not well answer
that purpose in houses which are so constructed as to
admit the external air almost on every side. Stoves
are, however, common in large buildings. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
stoves are situated frequently under the platforms on
which the inhabitants sit in the day time, and rest at
night. The worst weather experienced in that capital
might be considered as mild by the Tartars, coming
from a climate still more rude; but other foreigners
are said to feel themselves less comfortable at Pekin
in the winter than in the summer, though the heat is
then raised to the opposite extreme. In both they
seem to require a seasoning. <i>Several individuals of the
embassy fell ill during their stay; and all did not recover.</i>
The human frame seems calculated for the hottest
rather than the coldest atmosphere, and to exist at
the equator rather than the pole.”</p>

<p>Here we are involved in difficulties much greater than
before. It appears that even the fine climate of China
is healthful only to its own inhabitants. They can bear
the <i>vicissitudes</i> of the air, which Europeans cannot. The
prevention of plagues or mortal diseases then must consist
in some mode of living by which people can accommodate
themselves to the country which they inhabit,
and without which every other precaution will be ineffectual.
The diseases with which the attendants of the
ambassador were seized could not be owing to any slovenliness
or dirtiness in their lodgings or food, or to
want of apparel; nor were they more exposed to the
inclemencies of the air than others; only they were in a
strange country, where that inexplicable constitution of
the elements acted upon them in a manner different
from what it did on the natives, and, while it was
friendly to the latter, proved pernicious to the former.
But there was a time when even China was as unhealthy
as other countries; for the great plague in 1346 began
in the northern part of it. We have seen, in a former
section, that this was preceded by the most dreadful and
violent wars throughout the whole Asiatic continent.
Since the cessation of these violent wars the Chinese have
staid at home, and applied themselves to the arts of peace,
particularly to agriculture, which they have carried, we
may say, to its utmost perfection. This seems therefore
to be the true method of removing all those local causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
which produce epidemics, or at least of preventing them
from doing hurt; and, without attention to the natural
duties and occupations of man, it is to be feared that all
artificial modes of prevention will be found not only precarious
but ineffectual.</p>

<p>Dr. Smith in the dissertation above mentioned observes,
that “it may be doubted whether any <i>moral</i>
cause would be sufficient to protect, for a long period,
an unaccustomed resident in a marshy situation from
the usual consequences.” This is no doubt very probable
but, from the example of Lord Macartney’s attendants
in China, it appears equally probable that it
makes little difference whether the country be marshy
or not. Dr. Lind has many excellent observations upon
the subject of unhealthy countries, and gives particular
directions for strangers how to act, when obliged to
expose themselves to the inclemencies of the weather;
but none of these being effectual in preventing the access
of the true pestilence, we must still adhere to the
old Latin adage already quoted, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_302">302</a>. Flight seems
to be the most effectual method. To avoid migrations
to those countries where it usually rages, and, if it
were possible to persuade the inhabitants of such countries,
to imitate the example of Chinese industry, instead
of allowing the greater part of the territories they
possess to lie waste, would in all probability gradually
lessen both the frequency and violence of this terrible
disease. Migrations of large bodies of people,
especially for the purposes of war, are greatly to be
dreaded. If a few Englishmen, possessed of every thing
necessary, could not keep their health at Pekin, what
must have been the probable consequence of landing an
army of an hundred thousand, with a view to conquest?
Or what could we expect if the Chinese were to “pour
forth by millions” into other countries in order to conquer
them? Dr. Lind takes notice that even of the first
Portuguese adventurers to Africa, such as escaped the
first sickness continued afterwards to enjoy good health.
He likewise observes that many who left Britain, after being
seasoned to the countries to which they went, chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
rather to remain abroad for life, than to run a new risk
by going back to their own country. It is not therefore
so much the greater unhealthiness of the country to
which we go, as the <i>change</i>, which is to be dreaded. If
therefore great bodies of men will employ themselves in
constant rambling from one country to another, no
wonder that diseases break out among them, unknown,
either in the countries they have left, or those to which
they go.</p>

<p>We come now to the third mode of prevention, viz.
that of destroying the infection after it has begun to
exist. This is varied according to the nature of those
things which we suppose to be infected. The general
notion of infection taking place in the atmosphere has
been already spoken of; but the uncertainty of this
hypothesis, and the apparent impossibility of altering a
constitution of the atmosphere, must certainly leave
very little room for hope in this case. It hath, however,
been attempted by various methods. Hippocrates
adopted the opinion that all diseases were produced by
the air, and from him it was borrowed by Lucretius, as
we are informed by the annotator on Creech’s Translation
of that author. “In his book <i>de Flatibus</i> (of
winds) says the annotator, after a long narration of
the effects that the air produces, he at length falls on
the subject of diseases, all of which he affirms to be
bred and generated in the bodies of animals by means
of the air. First (says he) I will begin with the most
common fevorous disease, which accompanies, in a
manner, all diseases whatever. For there are two sorts
of fevers, one that is promiscuous, and common to
all, and is called the <i>plague</i>; the other, by reason of
unhealthful diet, is peculiar only to such as use that
diet; but of both these kinds of fevers the air is the
sole author and cause, for the common fever or plague
happens alike to all, because they all breathe the same
air; and it is certain that the like air, being alike mingled
in like bodies, must beget like fevers.” In consequence
of his theory, this great physician advised to have
recourse to fire as a purifier of air in times of pestilence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
But experience doth not warrant the success of this method;
neither indeed can we suppose that it could be successful,
unless people were able to kindle such fires as
would absorb the whole atmosphere of a country. This
method was tried in London without the least success;
nay, seemingly with bad effect; for, the very night the
fires were lighted, more than four thousand people died;
and, a few days after, an end was put to the experiment
by such violent rains as extinguished all the fires at once.</p>

<p>The burning of infected clothes has already been
taken notice of; but though this must certainly prevent
any new infection from arising from <i>these</i> clothes, it will
not prove that the infection may not evaporate during
the time of burning, and, being volatilized even beyond
its natural pitch, by the heat, may do mischief at
a greater distance than could have happened had they
been let alone. The instance, formerly quoted from
Dr. Huxham, of the small-pox being disseminated by
the smoke of burning infected clothes, if not a <i>proof</i>, affords
at least a strong presumption, of the danger of such
a practice. The only way of perfectly ensuring safety
in such a case would be to burn them by the sea-side,
when the wind blows from the shore. Were the smoke
allowed to pass over land, and great piles burnt at once,
it is impossible to say how far the contagion might be
carried<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span></p>

<p>Another mode of purification is by exposing suspected
goods to heat, to the vapour of vinegar, &amp;c. fumigating
with gun-powder, sulphur, &amp;c. and on this principle
various powders of fumigation have been invented;
some of which are said to have been very successful in
Russia; and the composition of one is given by Dr.
Alexander Russel in his Natural History of Aleppo;
but all these are undervalued by Dr. Guthrie<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> who calls
the practice of fumigation or smoaking, an “inadequate
and ineffectual ceremony.” Dr. Mitchel, also discommends
them, saying that they are advised “without any
proof that these destroy pestilential matter, and while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
at the same time, it is certain that they diminish more
or less the wholesomeness of the atmosphere with
which they are mingled.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> Of late the vapours of
pure nitrous acid (the <i>nitric</i>, according to the new nomenclature)
has been recommended, with the boldest
appeal to experience; but the consideration of this naturally
belongs to the second part of this work, where we
shall have occasion also to consider the theory of the
septic acid. In the mean time we must go on with some
farther account of the different modes of fumigation.</p>

<p>“There is no better corrective (says Allen from <span class="nowrap">Diemerbroeck<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>)
of a pestilential air, than fire; as much
experience has taught us. Hippocrates subdued and
extinguished that famous plague, which came amongst
the Grecians from Ethiopia; for he commanded great
fires to be kindled throughout the whole city, especially
in the night time, to purge away the pollutions
of the air. It is believed that a fire made with juniper-wood
or ash, tends much to correct the venomous
corruptions of the air. The kindling of sulphur and
gun-powder purify the air, and drive away its corruptions;
so does the burning of amber, pitch, frankincense,
&amp;c. so do the fumes of vinegar raised with red-hot
irons, or bricks.” According to Etmuller, “Hippocrates
drove away <i>that famous plague</i> in Greece by
the use of sulphur; the fumes of it are very much
commended to correct the air, and make drink more
wholesome; it prevents all manner of corruptions and
alterations, as well as the putridinous alteration of the
blood. In a great degree of malignity, the shirt and
clothes may be impregnated with the fume of
sulphur.”</p>

<p>Here we have accounts of a disease, called <i>that famous
plague</i>, driven away by two different methods; and, to
complete our dilemma, Dr. Canestrinus tells us that the
<i>plague at Athens</i> is said to have been staid “by sprinkling
the streets with wine.” What an expensive remedy,
when the odour of <i>privies</i> was afterwards found to answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
as well! “Whilst the plague was raging at Oczakow,
an <span class="nowrap"><i>earthquake</i><a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> happened on the very day that it
began to decline. In this case did any vapour issue
from the earth destructive of the pestilential contagion?
or did former noxious exhalations cease in
consequence of the convulsion of the earth<span class="nowrap">?<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> Sorbait
relates, that, in the time of the vintage in the
neighbourhood of Moselle, the plague ceased like a
miracle, while the must was in a fermenting state.
At Vienna likewise it was observed that, during and
at the close of the vintage, the disease manifestly declined;
which may have been owing to the great
quantity of fixed air in the atmosphere.”</p>

<p>To this our author adds, that “places adjoining to
spice-shops have generally remained free from infection;
and, in the plague of London, all those employed
in shipbuilding escaped the disease. Smiths
also and cooks remained uninfected.” M. Volney
tells us that, in Egypt, water-carriers are exempted;
and Baldwin, that oilmen are in the same happy predicament;
while on the other hand Allen quotes Boerhaave
saying, that “Forestus, Diemerbroeck, the French,
English, and Germans, observed, that all dealers in
soap, washers, and all who by their business used soap,
nay, <i>who only wore shirts washed with soap</i>, presently
died of the plague.”</p>

<p>From so many and so discordant opinions, the only
conclusion we can draw is, that, when once a pestilence
has invaded a country, there is not any possibility of
operating upon the contagion in such a manner as to
destroy it. If the plague ceases, it must do so naturally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
and we <i>cannot</i> accelerate this cessation. This is entirely
conformable to the opinion of Dr. Patrick Russel.
Speaking of the decline of the plague at Marseilles, and
the vigorous exertions of the magistrates to put a stop
to it, he says, “The causes now enumerated might no
doubt have some effect, but a more powerful and
general cause had begun long before to restrain the
havock of the pestilence, which had declined visibly
in the month of September, and in those of October,
November and December declined with a rapidity
not ascribable to the exertions of the most vigorous
police. This cause is generally supposed to be some
change in the constitution of the air; but which has
hitherto been defined with no better success than that
peculiar state of the atmosphere which, in conjunction
with contagion, is absolutely necessary to render the
plague epidemical.”</p>

<p>Dr. Russel takes notice of the methods of extinguishing
contagion already mentioned, by kindling fires, &amp;c.
and disapproves of them. We shall not therefore spend
more time in considering whether or not there is any
probability of eradicating or mitigating the violence of
a plague when once it is introduced. However this
may be impracticable in so large a space, it seems that it
certainly may be done in smaller spaces, ships for instance;
or, if not with the true plague, at least with malignant
and infectious fevers. Dr. Trotter, in his Medicina
Nautica, has laid down methods for accomplishing
this, and expresses the highest confidence in their
success. He adopts the doctrine of <i>contagion</i>, of which
he gives the same definition that in this treatise is given
of <i>infection</i>, viz. “Something propagated from diseased
bodies, or from substances that have been in contact
with them, producing a similar disease in other <span class="nowrap">persons<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>&mdash;the
propagation of contagion, as well as its
reception into the healthy body. A more aggravated
degree of malignity will generate a greater quantity of
infection, and, as it may be confined in a larger or
smaller space, it will be less or more noxious. A fever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
may be called malignant, when, with the symptoms
of debility, there is a cadaverous smell arising from the
body, an unusual fœtor of the breath, stools, and other
excretions, the tongue black and parched, the eye
dusky or yellow, the countenance bloated and dejected,
and the skin sallow. In approaching a sick bed of this
kind, a person not much accustomed to such visits
will be very liable to receive the infection; and the
unpleasant smell will be much sooner perceived than
by the physician or other attendants. We conclude
that a malignant typhus is more apt to generate contagion,
because slight cases are found not to extend
to others, even though no mode of precaution has been
used. The disease itself is incapable of generating infection,
till after a certain period; but this period is
uncertain: it seems to depend on the nature of the
symptoms, whether they are mild or malignant. <i>We
are assured of this fact, from a timely separation having
prevented the farther progress; and by this means</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">ALONE</span>,
<i>I apprehend, we eradicate contagion in</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">SHIPS</span>, <i>or</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">ANY
WHERE ELSE</span>. In the small-<span class="nowrap">pox<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> the disease seems
incapable of infecting another person before the second
or third day of the eruption. With the measles it is
otherwise. The disease may be propagated at the
most early stage of the eruption; and, if I was to be allowed
to conjecture on the subject, I would say, that
the contagion is the offspring of the catarrh (the cough
and hoarseness resembling a cold) which accompanies
the measles.</p>

<p>“Substances imbued with the exhalations from infected
bodies, if not exposed to the air, have their powers
of communicating the disease increased; or, in
other words, the infection from <i>fomites</i> (infected cotton,
clothes, &amp;c.) is said to become more virulent than it
was when first separated from the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>“I am of opinion, with others, that the exhalations or
excretions of the sick are the vehicles of contagion. It
is these which impregnate the atmosphere with noxious
matter: they affect in like manner bed-clothes, or
apparel, and every thing that can imbibe them, when
in contact with the diseased body. When bed-clothes,
or body-linen, but particularly silk or woolen cloth,
have been exposed to these exhalations, and then heaped
together for a length of time, the noxious effluvia
are, as it were, multiplied, and will more certainly
infect others than they did at first. The bales of goods
which brought the plague to Marseilles, and affected
the people that opened them so suddenly, had their
virulence increased by not being duly ventilated.
When the jail-fever was brought into court by the
prisoners at Oxford assizes, and more lately at the
Old Bailey, the fever was propagated from the clothing
of the prisoners; no doubt, from being confined in
impure, ill-aired cells, this infection became more virulent.
The highly concentrated state of contagion,
in the bales of goods, could only have been brought
to that degree of virulence from the closeness of the
package: it cannot be supposed that human beings
could have put them together otherwise. The nurses
of hospitals know well, as Dr. Lind tells us, that there
is most danger of catching a fever when they pile
heaps of bed-clothes or body-linen together for a
few days, before it is carried to the wash-house. The
washer-women at Haslar have also told me the same
thing. They know when a dangerous fever is in the
hospital by the bad smell of the clothes: this makes
them air them abroad, till the smell is gone, and then
they can wash them with safety. But, if it happened,
from the hurry, that this could not be done, or if it
was neglected by design, many of them were seized
with the sickness. The porters and people employed
in cleaning and fumigating the blankets and beds at
Haslar are well acquainted with this fact, and they
measure the danger by the badness of the smell. This
ought to instruct every body to stand to windward of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
these infected substances when they are opened; as
the current of air would then carry it the other way.
In one of the courts of justice, the people who stood
between the prisoners and a window, into which the
wind blew, escaped the infection, while those on the
other side were sufferers.</p>

<p>“In the summer of 1793, while the Orestes brig, commanded
by Lord Augustus Fitzroy, lay at Plymouth,
she was anchored very near and to leeward of an
army transport, which had on board a very malignant
fever among the soldiers. While the soldiers were
moved on deck, to go on shore to the hospital, the
crew of the Orestes, from curiosity, walked on deck to
look at them. Such was the concentrated state of
the contagion among the clothing and bedding of
these troops, on bringing them from below, that
eighteen people belonging to the brig were quickly
seized with the same fever, the infection of which
had been conveyed by the current of wind. It did
not, however, extend much farther in the Orestes,
from the attention of her commander. But this
ought to be a caution for ships to keep clear of those
that have fevers on board, as a <i>virulent</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">CONTAGION</span>
<i>may be conveyed to a considerable distance</i>.</p>

<p>“Dr. Lind is inclined to think that washing the
bed-linen in hot water, even when first shifted, is attended
with much risk; and that the noxious matter
may be volatilized by the heat of the water, and affect
the woman. For this purpose he has recourse to his
favourite process, of <i>fumigation</i>, to insure the washer-woman.
The heat of his fumigating furnace would
no doubt dry the linen, and exhale any moisture; but
our practice in the Charon (the hospital ship) was, to
plunge everything as it came from the bed into a tub of
hot water kept ready on purpose. The linen was washed
and dried immediately after. We had in that hospital
many malignant cases of typhus, and some deaths,
yet no infection was ever spread there.”</p>

<p>Our author next proceeds to inquire into the cause of
this excessive concentration of the infectious matter in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
<i>fomites</i>, or clothes, bed-clothes, bale-goods, &amp;c. The
most plausible reason, he says, that could for some time
be assigned for this, “was, the generation of animalcula;
the cotton or woollen clothing was said to serve as a
nest for the corpuscles to multiply; and thus the contagion
was thought to increase seven fold.” This
theory had an effect on the practice of physicians, both as
to the prevention and cure of fevers supposed to proceed
from thence. Our author looks upon the hypothesis to
be chimerical, because none of these animalcules have
ever been made visible by the best microscopes. But
there is no necessity for supposing the animalcules to be
invisible to the naked eye. They may creep on the
ground, or fly in the air, without being observed by us.
Mr. Baker’s discovery of the insect which not only poisoned
<i>eleven hundred thousand</i> times its bulk of water,
but infected a much greater bulk of air, with its effluvia<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span>
shows that such a thing may be <i>possible</i>; and in dubious
matters bare possibility ought always to produce inquiry.
If the perspiration of human bodies when confined
becomes noxious, why may not that of a multitude
of insects be so too? There is no necessity for
supposing that an insect must be swallowed, or inhaled
by the breath, before it can do hurt. What Dr. Trotter
says of the variolous contagion emitted from the
human body will apply equally to insects. “What has
been called the insensible perspiration (says he) which
arises from the surface and the lungs, we have a right
to believe carries with it in solution a portion of the
variolous matter which charges the atmosphere with
the contagion of small-pox, even in such quantities as
to impregnate the clothing of attendants and visitors;
by which means it has been frequently carried to families
and villages many miles distant from its source.”
The smallness of size of insects can be little objection
here. A skunk is but a small animal, yet it spreads its
odour farther than an hundred diseased human bodies
could propagate the plague<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>On this subject, however, we may remark, that though
the nurses and attendants on hospitals measure the degree
of infection by the smell, yet people are by no means
safe in approaching patients about whom no smell can
be perceived. We have already seen, from Dr. Fordyce,
that what may be called the <i>pure</i> infection of fevers
is not perceptible by any of our senses; and there
are examples of very offensive smells issuing from diseased
bodies without any contagion ensuing. Dr. Trotter
tells us, that “a patient in typhus was sent from the
Venerable to the hospital ship, with a fœtor about
him, that exceeded any thing of the kind that ever
came within the Doctor’s knowledge. After being
washed and shifted, it still continued, and was perceived
at a considerable distance. He died in a few
days, yet nobody was infected from him, either in his
own ship, or in our hospital. There was probably
some peculiarity of constitution here.” In M. Deidier’s
experiments, above related, the dog which eat
the dressings of the plague sores, after being infected with
the disease, emitted a very disagreeable odour, but we
do not find that the odour was in any way infectious.
In the Encycloped. Britan, art. Med. <i>Hydrophobia</i>, we
find an account of an hydrophobic patient (and a patient
who recovered) in whom the blood drawn from a
vein was as black as ink, and stunk abominably, yet this
stench was attended with no bad consequence. There
is therefore no essential connexion between offensive
smells and contagion; yet, as they are sometimes united,
the absence of the smell ought not to encourage us rashly
to go into suspicious places, neither ought the presence
of it to deter us from venturing where we have otherwise
good reason to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>Having given up the doctrine of animalcula, the
Doctor goes on to explain the doctrine of concentrated
contagion in a manner very similar to that given in this
treatise, viz. from the decomposition of some kind of
gas. “The fœtor of the breath (says he) perspirable
matter, &amp;c. evidently demonstrate that they differ from
the healthy state. The smell, to our senses, comes very
near what is called <i>sulphurated-hydrogenous gas</i>. Some
of the fluids within the body would seem to be in some
degree in a state of actual decomposition; unless we can
suppose the mucous glands of the lungs secreting a fluid
that taints the expired air in this manner. The decomposition
of the fat, which sometimes disappears very suddenly
in fevers, may give some ground for the supposition
that a large portion of these exhalations are composed
of hydrogenous gas. But, whether we can go thus
far or not, what is separated from the body, it is plain,
is more disposed to decomposition than when the
body is in health. Now this process will still go on,
whether exposed to the atmosphere or not, with this
difference, that, by exposing substances which have
imbibed the exhalations of the diseased to a free air,
the noxious gases will be dissipated as quickly as they
are evolved; while, on the other hand, by laying the
clothes in a heap, packing them firm in a chest, or
making up cloth into small bales, the gases are concentrated
into a small space; and woe to the man
who first inspires them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now this does not hold
out an idea that the powers of contagion are multiplied,
as by generation; for that would be to say, that these
gases are <i>themselves</i> what we call the matter of infection.
I would only go so far as to assert that they are
the vehicles of it, till more certain experience shall
determine farther.”</p>

<p>With respect to fumigations with nitrous acid, our author
repeatedly declares that he has no confidence in
them; nay, he brings instances where they seemed to have
bad effects. But as the dispute about fumigation has no
connexion with the true plague, nitrous acid having
never been used as a preventive for it, we shall defer any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
farther consideration of it to the second part of this treatise,
to which it naturally belongs.</p>

<p>We come now to the fourth and last mode of prevention,
viz. a consideration of those means by which an
individual, without separating himself from society, and
who is daily obliged to have communication with the
sick, may yet secure himself against infection. Here the
means recommended are extremely various, and some of
them so opposite, that we can scarce avoid suspecting them
all. The misfortune is, that though a person should go,
without fear, among the sick, though he should constantly
take a medicine, and should never have the distemper,
yet we cannot say whether the medicine did
preserve him or not. Were it possible to know the
particular constitution of the body which disposed some
to resist the attack of the disease, attempts might be
made to bring the constitutions of others to the same
standard, but unfortunately our ignorance here is so great,
that any attempt to alter the constitution of the body
has generally proved unfortunate even in other diseases.
Dr. Lind informs us, that the first Portuguese adventurers
in Africa, having observed, that “such as had
the good fortune to escape a fit of sickness or death,
soon after their arrival, enjoyed afterwards a pretty
good state of health, thence concluded, that the blood
of such persons had been entirely changed by the diet
of the country. Upon this erroneous principle they
adopted a most fatal method of seasoning people to
these unhealthy climates. They, by small quantities,
frequently repeated, took away as much blood as they
supposed to be contained in the body, and thus they
reduced the patient to a state of extreme weakness.”
From its being observed that people of delicate constitutions
are less liable to the plague than others, such
a mistake probably has also been made with regard to
this distemper, but with equally bad success. Allen
tells us from Diemerbroeck, “<i>Phlebotomy</i>, though mightily
cried up by many of the ancient and modern
physicians, yet we reject it altogether, <i>as very dangerous
and detrimental</i>; for it appeared by experience that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
those who made use of it for prevention’s sake were
seized with the plague soon after bleeding, wherefore
we forbad it to all.” This may seem surprising, as we
find bleeding so much recommended by Sydenham as
a remedy; but by others it is equally reprobated; nay,
Dr. Hodges tells us that he never knew but one who
recovered from the disease after the use of it. Issues
seem more likely, if not to prevent, at least to render the
disease more mild if it should attack. They are recommended
by Diemerbroeck, and Russel speaks of them as,
“by some authors, represented as almost infallible.”
He cannot, however, recommend them from his own
experience, having never seen them opened for the purpose
of preventing the plague; and he justly observes,
that when habitual on any other account, they may perhaps
lose their effect in this. “Multitudes (says he) of
both sexes at Aleppo had issues in their arms, it being
there a very common remedy in a variety of chronic
disorders: but, notwithstanding those outlets, numbers
perished; and I did not remark that those who
had them were in any degree less liable than others to
be infected.”</p>

<p>Tobacco has been recommended as an excellent preservative,
particularly by Diemerbroeck, who writes with
a kind of enthusiasm in its favour. “Being called
(said he) to visit a patient afflicted with the plague, as
soon as I entered his chamber I felt a most offensive
smell of excrements (for he had a diarrhœa) with
which I was greatly affected. Leaving the house
after a very short visit, I instantly found myself seized
with giddiness, nausea, and uneasiness at the heart; so
that I had no doubt of my having caught the pestilential
contagion. Laying aside all business, therefore, I
immediately returned home, and smoked five or six
pipes of the best tobacco; by the use of which all the
above-mentioned symptoms so totally vanished, that
I felt not the least uneasiness any more. Then, being
again desirous to go abroad and visit other sick people,
I took a drachm of theriaca, and from thence-forward
was in perfect health. The same thing happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
to me three or four times during the time of
this pestilence; and without loss of time, according
to the quantity of infection I supposed that I had
taken in, I had recourse to the more plentiful use of
tobacco, by which my health was restored. I always
looked upon tobacco to be an excellent preventive
remedy, and its smoke I have sometimes found useful
to myself even in an incipient attack of the disease<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span>”
He then proceeds to inform us of a report that in a violent
plague at London all the dealers in tobacco were
exempted. At Nimeguen, however, they were not so
fortunate; yet of the family of the principal tobacco
merchant (Thomas Peters, an Englishman) which was
very large, none were infected, excepting only one servant
maid, and she quickly recovered.</p>

<p>On this remedy Dr. Russel makes the same remark as
on the issues. “The custom of smoking (says he), is
universal among both men and women at Aleppo.
This too, from its being habitually practised, might
perhaps lose part of its prophylactic virtue: at the
same time those who use it as a preservative must
always be supposed in some degree accustomed to it,
otherwise the violence of its operation on most persons,
on their first beginning to smoke, might prove
hurtful. It should further be observed, that the tobacco
commonly used in Syria is much milder than
the American, and that the oriental smokers seldom or
never spit.”</p>

<p>It hath been observed that the plague is stopped either
by great heat or great cold, but more readily by the
former than the latter. “It has generally been supposed
(says Dr. Canestrinus) that the cold of winter was
destructive of contagious matter; but various instances
of the contrary may be collected. The plague in
Transylvania continued through the very severe frost
in 1709. On the contrary it has been found, that
excessive heat has extinguished, or at least diminished,
pestilential diseases. During the plague at Aleppo
the weather was unusually hot in the beginning of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
July, and it was remarked that the disease declined
considerably; and in general Dr. Russel observed,
that the plague ceased at the hottest season of the
year. The plague at Ockzacow, which raged in the
years 1738 and 1739, began in the month of April,
and continued with violence till July, when it declined
considerably, and entirely ceased in the month
of September; in February of the year following it
re-appeared, and totally ceased in July.”</p>

<p>From these facts we might be led to suppose that a
warm regimen, or occasionally exposing the body to
great heat, might be advantageously used by way of
prevention; but Dr. Russel justly observes, that the human
frame, “could it support such an application of fire
and smoke as is necessary to expel or destroy contagion
from infected substances, would probably receive little
benefit from it, if infected; nor could those in health
sustain, without prejudice, the heat and dense smoke
which is probably required for the perfect extinction
of the infectious effluvia floating in the confined atmosphere
of a morbid body.” He is of opinion,
however, that some kinds of fumigations may be of use,
and he mentions some of these, but says that the perfumes
ordered by the college are perhaps as proper as
any, though their forms might be rendered more simple.
Heat alone can scarce be thought very proper for prevention,
and, when the disease is once begun, is said to
be detrimental. Dr. Guthrie quotes Baron Ash saying,
that “in heated rooms the disease is ungovernable: it
is only in free air that it is to be treated.” But of late
a discovery has been made of a surprising power in
heated oil of removing this disease, insomuch that, if we
can believe what has been published of it, we must suppose
it to be little less than a specific. So great indeed
has been the confidence put in this method, that, by
order of the Academy of Sciences at Lisbon, it has been
translated into Arabic, French and Portuguese<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> “The
method was first proposed by George Baldwin esq.
agent for his Britannic Majesty, and consul-general at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Alexandria. He communicated his method to Lewis
de Pavia, chaplain and agent to St. Anthony’s Hospital
at Smyrna; who, after five years experience,
pronounces it to be the most effectual remedy hitherto
made use of in the hospital of which he has had the
management for twenty-seven years. Immediately
after a person is perceived to be infected with the
plague, he must be taken into a close room; and, over
a brazier of hot coals, with a clean sponge, dipped in
warm olive oil, his body must be very briskly rubbed
all over; for the purpose of producing a profuse sweat.
During the friction, sugar and juniper berries must be
burned in the fire, which raise a dense and hot smoke,
that contributes to the effect. The friction ought
not to be continued more than four minutes, and a
pint of oil is enough to be used at each time. In general
the first rubbing is attended by a very copious
perspiration; but, should it fail of this effect, the operation
may be repeated, first wiping the body with a
warm, dry cloth; and, in order to promote perspiration
still farther, the patient may take any warm sudorific
drink, such as elder-flower water, tea, &amp;c. It
is not necessary to touch the eyes; and other tender
parts of the body must be touched gently. Every
possible precaution must be made use of to prevent
the patient from taking cold, nor must the linen be
changed till the perspiration has entirely subsided.
The operation should be repeated once a day, until
evident symptoms of recovery begin to appear. If
there are already tumours on the body, they should be
gently and more frequently rubbed, till they appear
to be in a state of suppuration, when they may be
dressed with the usual plasters. The operation ought
to be begun on the first appearance of the symptoms
of disease; if neglected till the nerves and the mass
of blood are affected, or a diarrhœa has commenced,
little hopes can be entertained of a cure; but still
the patient should not be despaired of, as, by an assiduous
application of the means proposed, some few
have recovered, even after diarrhœa had commenced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
During the first four or five days the patient
must observe a very abstemious diet; the author
allows only a small quantity of vermicelli, simply
boiled in water. Nor must any thing be taken
for thirty or forty days, except very light food, as, he
says, an indigestion in any state of the disorder might
be dangerous. He does not allow the use of wine
till forty days. There is no instance of the person
rubbing a patient having taken the infection. He
should previously anoint himself all over with oil, and
must avoid receiving the infected person’s breath into
his mouth or nostrils. The precaution to be used in
all circumstances is that of carefully anointing the
body, and living upon light and easily digestible food.
Mr. Baldwin observes, that among upwards of a
million of people carried off by the plague in Upper
and Lower Egypt, in the space of four years, he could
not discover a single oilman, or dealer in oil.” <i>Lisbon,
July, 1797. By Royal Permission.</i></p>

<p>With regard to diet, and the use of spiritous liquors,
opinions, as may well be imagined, have been very discordant.
Allen quotes Diemerbroeck advising <i>poor people</i>
to take two or three spoonfuls of the best white wine
vinegar every morning, which he looked upon to be one
of the best preservatives: he recommends also the frequent
application to the nostrils of a spunge dipped in
<i>treacle vinegar</i>. With regard to himself he says that his
principal care was to avoid uneasy passions of the mind;
and that when he found himself any way disturbed by
these, he cheered his heart by three or four glasses of
wine: his common drink was beer, and also white wine,
small, or moderately strong, which sometimes he drank
to cheerfulness, but never to drunkenness. Dr. Patrick
Russel also says, that “a glass of generous wine, or any
other cordial more agreeable to the choice, may be
taken before dinner, in case of languor, or oppression
at the stomach, from fatigue, fœtor, or apprehension.
<i>I found a rummer of old hock very agreeable on such occasions.</i>”
Allen goes on to inform us from Diemerbroeck,
that, “as to diet, it is advisable in a pestilential disposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
to use temperance, which very much contributes
to the preservation of health; but all sudden changes
are dangerous; wherefore it is most dangerous suddenly
to alter the usual rule of diet. It is very ill in the
plague to go abroad with an empty stomach: hog’s
flesh is looked upon to be very pernicious: all sweet
things are to be avoided: wine moderately made use
of is good, but the abuse of it very dangerous.&mdash;Mercurialis
testifies, that among the Patavians and Venetians,
most of the tipplers died, who thought to drive
out the plague with strong wines.” Mr. Howard informs
us, that a person in high station at Constantinople,
attributed his recovery entirely to the use of <i>green tea</i>,
others to <i>brandy</i>. He also mentions a Mr. Hare, master
of a merchant vessel at Senegal, who, during the prevalence
of a malignant fever there, was very much exposed
to the infection, and who out of humanity waited upon
a negro, whom nobody would go near. He took no
medicines, neither did he taste either spiritous or fermented
liquors, and was the <i>only</i> European that entirely escaped
the contagion<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span></p>

<p>These accounts seem to evince that little or nothing
is to be expected from a change of diet. This is an attempt
to change the constitution of the body, and cannot
be expected to succeed any more than bleeding.
There is a certain quantity, and a certain species, both
of food and drink, different in different persons, necessary
to preserve health, and those who require both in larger
quantity or better quality than others, are no more to be
charged with intemperance than those who are supported
by the smallest quantity of the coarsest fare. In
times of danger, therefore, those who have been accustomed
to spiritous liquors ought not to give them over;
neither ought those to begin the use of them who have
not used them before. From the account formerly
given of the structure of the human body, it appears to
be furnished with an apparatus for <i>exhaling</i> or throwing
out a perspirable matter as well as for <i>inhaling</i> or taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
in one equally subtile. How far the skin may be able
to <i>inhale</i> or rather <i>imbibe</i> surrounding effluvia, may be
doubted; but with the lungs there cannot be any doubt;
and the effluvia taken into them must unquestionably
affect the blood, and of consequence the vital principle,
almost without any medium. To deprive the body of
its due portion of nourishment therefore is to <i>throw a
temptation in its way</i> (if I may use the expression) to absorb
<i>any thing</i>; and the same effect must ensue from
any other mode of debilitating it, either by intemperance,
terror, or the like; and hence to visit infected places
while under any such debility must be very imprudent.
Dr. Russel agrees that it is a general and rational precept,
never to go abroad fasting. For those who cannot
easily bear fatigue without eating between breakfast
and dinner, some light food may be proper, at an intermediate
hour, in order to avoid going into the chambers
of the sick with an empty stomach in the forenoon.
“In such circumstances (says he) after a long and
fatiguing morning, I have often found myself disagreeably
affected in my latter visits, and have been sensible
of slight giddiness, and of the appetite flagging at
dinner, as if something lay on the stomach. I have
known others much more strongly affected in this
manner, and consequently much more alarmed. In
such cases much no doubt may depend on the fancy;
but in those times the power of the imagination
requires management. So intimately is it connected
with the accidental state of the body, that the same
risk, from which a man shrinks in a state of languor
and fatigue, he will encounter undauntedly after a
temperate meal: the strange, unusual sensations, which
amount almost to a persuasion of having caught the
infection, will often, like the phantoms of a vision,
vanish after a few glasses of wine<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> Whether any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
slight degree of real infection can be thus dissipated,
I shall not take upon me to determine; it is sufficient
for the present purpose to indicate the means of restraining
those alarming sensations which, when aggravated
by imagination, are apt to depress the spirits,
and, according to the general opinion, to reduce the
human body to that <i>relaxed</i>, <i>inhaling</i> state peculiarly
susceptible of contagion.”</p>

<p>As to other modes of precaution, the Doctor advises
that such as are about the sick “should guard the mouth
and nostrils with vinegar, avoid drawing in the breath
while close to the bed side, or swallowing their spittle
while in the infected chamber. Before they approach
the bed in order to examine the eruptions, the bed-clothes
ought to be removed, to give time for the
dispersion of a confined steam which immediately discovers
itself to the senses; and it will be advisable
to dip the hands in vinegar before examining the
parts. On coming out of the chamber it will also
be proper to rinse the mouth, and wash the hands,
with vinegar, plain or camphorated.” He advises also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
to fumigate the clothes with nitre, sulphur, and juniper
berries, burnt on a red-hot iron.</p>

<p>“Upon returning home it may be advisable to shift
clothes immediately, hanging those taken off upon
lines in a small chamber, to be again smoked, and afterwards
aired. The mouth and hands ought once
more to be well washed, and the hair might be fumigated
with a little nitre and sulphur, by means of a
pipe, so as not to incommode the lungs.”</p>

<p>One other mode of prevention, not of the disease, but
of incurring danger from it, is inoculation. This is
greatly recommended by Baron Ash above mentioned,
and not only for the plague among the human species,
but for that among cattle, which frequently destroys
great numbers of those necessary animals. The case of
Mathias Degio related p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_272">272</a>, shows the practicability
and the safety of it. The only solid objection that can
be made to it is, that those who have once had the plague
are not secure from having it a second time, or oftener.
Yet, if we consider the extreme fatality of the disease
when it attacks in the natural way, and that the number
of those who have the plague only once is much greater
than of those who relapse, this practice will certainly be
found to merit consideration, and, unless some objection
to it be discovered greater than any that has yet
appeared, seems likely to be advantageous to the human
race in general.</p>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Of the Cure of the Plague.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">F<span class="ls01em">ROM</span> what has already been laid down in a former
section concerning the nature of this distemper, it
appears, in its worst and most deadly form, to consist in
the sudden breaking forth of a kind of hard mortifications,
or rather eschars, like those made by fire, in different
parts of the body. When these happen to fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
upon any of the vital parts, it is evident that no cure
can be applied. When such eschars discover themselves
in abundance on the external parts, it is likewise observed
that the patient certainly dies; whether from the
same taking place inwardly, or from nature not being
able to bear the loss of substance, and to separate so many
deep eschars, is uncertain: but this kind, which attacks
without fever, has always been reckoned absolutely
incurable. When the tendency to internal mortification
is less, and the fiery blasts, if we may so call them,
approach the surface, so that buboes or carbuncles begin
to appear, there is then some hope that the patient may
recover. Even here, however, the case must be considered
as very doubtful, and we have seen that in Dr.
Russel’s three first classes of patients not one recovered;
nevertheless, as we are not always able to distinguish
with certainty whether the patient is altogether beyond
the power of medicine or not, excepting where the
<i>tokens</i> formerly mentioned appear, this kind only is
here distinguished by the name of the <i>fatal</i> or inevitably
mortal kind of plague. In all cases, where there is time
allowed, medicine ought to be employed; but, as in
other diseases, different theories have bred such a contradiction
of opinions, that it is with no small difficulty
we can judge which has any <i>probability</i> of success. In
this uncertainty, however, we must look upon those who
have recently had an opportunity of seeing the disease as
superior not only to those who have only <i>read</i> of it, but
even to the most celebrated ancient physicians who have
written upon the subject. Those who have had the best
and latest opportunities of seeing the distemper are Drs.
Alexander and Patrick Russel at Aleppo, and the physicians
to the Russian army when the plague raged in it
in 1770, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexander Russel begins with observing that
“the discordant opinions of medical writers concerning
the method of treating the plague are innumerable.
In regard to bleeding and other evacuations, they
maintain opinions diametrically opposite; some recommending
them as indispensably requisite, others decrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
them as invariably pernicious; while both parties,
with equal confidence, appeal to experience. But, in
a disease wherein reason is often perplexed, and experience
itself fallacious, it is greatly to be lamented that
nature is not more, and opinion less, consulted.</p>

<p>“No traces of any satisfactory method of cure are to
be met with among the natives at Aleppo. The Mahommedans,
holding the plague to be a penal curse inflicted
by Almighty God on a sinful people, have less
faith in the efficacy of medicine in that disease than
any other: and, as the chief of those who practise
physic are either Christians or Jews, not armed with the
doctrine of predestination, and consequently apprehensive
of contracting the infection, they (the physicians)
endeavour to confirm the vulgar notion of the inutility
of their art in the plague, with a prudential view
of evading the danger of being forced to visit the sick.
Hence the greatest part of the infected are either left
to struggle with the disease without any assistance
from medicine, or are under the necessity of submitting
to the direction of the meanest and most ignorant
of mankind.”</p>

<p>The whole practice of the native physicians consists
in bleeding, let the stage of the distemper be what it
will, and afterwards attempting to raise a sweat with the
insignificant remedy of a few grains of bezoar mixed
with the distilled water of scorzonera. On the subject
of evacuations our author remarks, that bleeding, even
very plentifully, was always useful in the beginning, but
as constantly prejudicial after the first day. Vomiting
was equally useful at the same period; with mere warm
water, if that would answer the purpose, but if not, small
drops of ipecucuanha or sal vitrioli might be added.
Violent cathartics were hurtful, but an emollient clyster
or laxative of manna and cream of tartar were not only
safe but serviceable. “On the second day of the disease
(says the Doctor) where the remissions of the
symptoms were tolerably distinct, I have frequently
and successfully given an infusion of senna with manna
and cream of tartar; and it is a fact confirmed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
me by repeated experience, that a purgative of this
lenient kind, given after the critical sweat, was the
most effectual means of promoting the suppuration of
the buboes.</p>

<p>“The natural crisis of the disease was always by the
skin. When a copious sweat could be procured by
art, it was likewise of service; but the attempt, if
made the first day, was attended with two material
inconveniences: the first, that the common diaphoretic
medicines, if given in the usual dose, if they
failed in their operation, threw the patient into a
flame, and greatly augmented all their symptoms;
the second, that, though they produced the desired
effect, it was necessary to keep up the sweat a much
longer time than most people of that country could
be persuaded to endure; and, if the sweat was prematurely
checked by exposure to the air, all the symptoms
were either exasperated, or (what was often the case)
a diarrhœa was induced, which, though at first it might
seem to relieve, yet generally proved fatal in the
end.”</p>

<p>Contrayerva and valerian, saffron, the compound
powder of contrayerva of the Edinburgh College, are
recommended as sudorifics; given in small doses every
four hours, with acidulated diluent drinks. These medicines
were occasionally joined with anodynes, among
which syrup of poppies was reckoned preferable to opium.
In cases of diarrhœa, Venice treacle or diascordium
were joined with the diaphoretics. Neither bark
nor snakeroot could have a fair trial, on account of the
prejudices of the people: and on this occasion our author
observes, that “the physician who would obtain a
ready compliance with his directions, in that country,
must as seldom as possible offend the palates of his
patients with nauseous remedies; for, whatever may
be the consequence, they will often rather choose to
incur distant though great risks, than avoid them by
submitting to present inconveniences.” Nitrous medicines
were found ineligible on various accounts:
1. They did not, as in other diseases, allay heat. 2. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
sick could not bear them in ordinary doses without languor
and dejection. 3. They were apt to bring on a
diarrhœa.&mdash;The following is an epitome of our author’s
practice:</p>

<p>1. Bleeding from ten to twenty ounces as soon as
possible after the seizure. The quantity seldom exceeded
sixteen ounces, and even this is greatly above
what is taken in any other disease in that country.</p>

<p>2. After bleeding, where the nausea was considerable,
the stomach was cleansed with warm water; or, if that
failed, with ipecucuanha or salt of vitriol. It was of
such importance to have both these evacuations performed
early, that our author instructed most of his acquaintance
how to act if they should be infected.</p>

<p>3. A gentle anodyne succeeded the vomit. If by it
the stomach was not quieted, an ounce of diascordium,
or 15 drops of laudanum, were added to the saline
draught of Riverius.</p>

<p>4. Small doses of cordial and diaphoretic medicines,
with a very small quantity of antimoniated nitre, were
exhibited every four hours; the sick were encouraged
to drink freely of a decoction of scorzonera roots and
barley, or spring water moderately acidulated with spirit
of vitriol. A mixture of the acid with syrup of violets
was kept ready to be added to plain water. All the
drink was given warm if the patient would be prevailed
upon to take it so.</p>

<p>5. In the winter the sick were removed into more airy
lodgings than those in which they usually slept, and the
air of the room was warmed or corrected by a moderate
fire. In summer only the windows opposite to the patient’s
bed were ordered to be shut; but even this restriction
was not universally complied with; many insisting
upon setting all the windows open in the day
time, and sleeping on the house top at night.</p>

<p>6. In case of faintness and uneasiness, a cordial, composed
of some of the simple distilled waters, tinctures of
saffron and valerian, alkermes, and spirit of vitriol, was
used with advantage and great refreshment to the sick.
This with plenty of acidulated drinks was the chief prescription
for infected children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>Under the above treatment, a sweat often broke out
on the second or beginning of the third day; after which
the sick were covered up, and the sweat encouraged as
long as they could be persuaded to bear it. By this first
sweat, especially if it happened on the second day, the
patient was never freed from the fever, though greatly
relieved. It was therefore necessary to continue the
same medicines, in order, by a more plentiful sweat, to
procure a perfect crisis. Where the sweat was supposed
to be sufficiently copious, and had greatly mitigated the
symptoms, a mild cathartic was given in the morning,
though some degree of fever still remained; the other
medicines not being intermitted during its operation.
An anodyne was given in the evening.</p>

<p>In case of an exacerbation of the symptoms or the
depression of the buboes, as sometimes happened on the
second or third day, it was useful to apply a blister just
below the tumour. A blister to the head was useful in
cases of coma and debility of the tongue. The natives
were exceedingly averse to the use of blisters; but, having
observed that some who had been judged past recovery
had nevertheless struggled through, apparently from the
use of blisters, they at last came into some degree of credit.
Cataplasms, composed of garlic, bread and vinegar,
were advantageously applied to the soles of the feet.
These, as well as blisters, were useful in cases of coma;
also emollient laxative clysters. The dose of the alexipharmics
was increased, and acidulated drinks, in small
quantities at a time, given frequently.</p>

<p>To the buboes it was customary to apply suppurative
cataplasms; but, as these could not, where the patient
was desirous of walking, be easily kept on, a diachylon
gum plaster was substituted, with the addition of few
cantharides, or a little euphorbium, if a greater stimulus
was judged necessary. In most cases the buboes were
left to open of themselves; the natives being afraid of
the lancet or caustic, and sometimes operators being
wanting. No bad consequence ensued on their being
left to open of themselves, nor was any particular treatment
necessary. Where they mortified, the treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
was the same as in carbuncles, and though, after the separation
of the gangrened parts, the ulcer often remained
wide and deep, yet they healed kindly and in a short
time.</p>

<p>Sometimes the carbuncles were scarified, but oftener
not. The best dressings were pledgits of yellow basilicon,
with a small proportion of oil of turpentine, or sometimes
tincture of myrrh, with an emollient cataplasm
over all.</p>

<p>Dr. Patrick Russel complains that, in Turky, physicians
are laid under such restraints, by popular prejudices,
that they are sometimes obliged to remain almost
passive spectators of the disease. The natives are fond
of bleeding, and will at any time let blood in the hot
stages, when the febrile symptoms run high. About two
thirds of the infected were bled at the arm; but from
the rapid progress of the disease, and the quick transition
to the low, languid state, few were bled more than once,
and that usually within the first forty hours. The time
of bleeding was usually the first night, or some time on
the second day; but sometimes not till the third. Where
the operation was repeated, it was usually on the third,
sometimes on the fifth, and even on the sixth; he has
even met with instances wherein the patient was three or
four times bled, the last being as late as the seventh day.
In his own practice he usually advised one bleeding at
the beginning, except in the very young, aged, or infirm.
On the first day, if not forbid by circumstances, bleeding
was ordered by way of precaution; but on the succeeding
days it was regulated by the state of the pulse,
and other symptoms. Where the infection was slight,
and the febrile symptoms moderate, or did not come on
till some days after the eruptions, it was wholly omitted.
The quantity of blood taken away seldom exceeded
eight or ten ounces. Cupping was used by the natives,
but never ordered by Dr. Russel. Children were scarified
in the legs. He seldom had an opportunity of
examining the blood drawn from a vein; but, in such
cases as occurred, the general appearance was little different
from that of healthy blood; the crassamentum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
was sometimes of a darkish colour, but never sizy or
resolved.</p>

<p>With regard to the propriety or impropriety of bleeding,
or at least the success attending it, we can best judge
from the histories of cases given by Dr. Russel at the
end of his work. Of these there are an hundred and
twenty, with some supernumeraries, giving an account of
the cases of the attendants, &amp;c. Of these, sixty-five
were bled; forty died, and twenty-five recovered.</p>

<p>Of these hundred and twenty cases at large, fifty-seven
recovered, as many died, and the event of six was
unknown. This would tend to give us some considerable
idea of the Doctor’s success; but, when we take into
account the time of the year in which these cases were
treated, the matter will appear in a quite different light.
Twenty-seven took place mostly in the earlier part of the
season, and were of consequence more violent than the
others; and, of these, twenty-one died, five recovered,
and the event of the other case was uncertain. Of the
rest only thirty-six died, and fifty-four recovered. Such
an excessive disproportion cannot be ascribed to the medical
treatment, but to the nature of the disease itself,
growing milder as it extended wider. In many of these
cases it is not mentioned whether the patients took any
medicines or not; nevertheless, as it must always be supposed
that a physician would prescribe something for his
patient, it must also be supposed that all took medicines,
excepting where we are expressly told that they did not.
The cases in which he mentions the medicines employed
were the following:</p>

<p>1. A young man of 20, suddenly seized, was bled largely;
had a vomit of ipecacuanha, which brought off a
quantity of bile, but without putting a stop to the natural
retchings. Some diaphoretic medicines were given,
which did not remain on his stomach, and he did not
sweat. These were stopped by a draught of juice of
lemons and alkaline salt taken in the act of effervescence.
Sinapisms were applied to the feet, and he died the third
night at midnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

<p>2. A widow lady about 40, of a thin, delicate habit,
in whom the disease came on gradually, was bled on the
third day, and took diaphoretic medicines and acidulated
cordials till the 9th. She died on the 11th.</p>

<p>3. A Jewish rabbi, between 30 and 40, of a thin,
spare habit, was bled on the 2d day, and died early on
the morning of the 4th.</p>

<p>4. A Jewish boy, between seven and eight years old,
of a pale, unhealthy complexion, was repeatedly purged,
and had suppurative cataplasms applied to the buboes
without effect. He recovered slowly. Dr. Russel was
not called till the seventh day of the disease, and we are
not informed when the purgatives were administered.</p>

<p>5. A Jewish lad of 14, healthy and florid, was visited
on the third day. He had already been scarified in the
legs, and bleeding was ordered; but, as he became faint,
only a small tea-cupful could be taken away. The
blood, after two hours, was found to have a soft and
loose texture, somewhat blackish on the surface; but
the quantity of serum was not greater than usual. It
had appeared of a blackish colour at first. He had a
vomit, draughts with spiritus mindereri; afterwards a
diaphoretic mixture and acidulated cordial, and sinapisms
to the feet. On the seventh day he sweated copiously,
and was much relieved, but soon relapsed. On
the 10th he sweated early in the morning, and had a
temporary relief, but soon became worse than ever. On
the eleventh he had three stools of black blood. One
of these, kept for the Doctor’s inspection, consisted of
about three tea-cupfuls, without any fœtor; the others
were “inconsiderably small.” Some tincture of bark
was now added to his usual mixture. On the 15th he
had a purging potion which operated five times, had an
opiate at night, and tincture of bark with elixir of vitriol
was ordered twice a day. Next day he was quite free of
fever, and quickly recovered.</p>

<p>6. A Jew of a thin, spare habit, who took no medicines,
died on the sixth day. His wife, of a delicate
frame, and six months gone with child, was bled in the
arm, had “proper drinks” directed for her, brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
forth a child in the agonies of death, and expired on the
sixth day. They were extremely poor, and Dr. Russel
says of the house they inhabited, that it “was one of
those miserable dwellings which he had always considered
as one of the receptacles of contagion.” It did not,
however, appear to be so; for, though there were other
six in the family, only one of them was infected, who
died in ten days.</p>

<p>7. A youth of a delicate constitution, a French native
of Aleppo, was visited on the morning of the third
day. He had a carbuncle on his neck, which had been
mistaken for an ordinary inflammation, and a physician
who had previously visited him applied a galbanum
plaster, ordering also some nitrous medicines; but the
plaster giving much pain, it was changed for a common
poultice. Live pigeons were applied to the feet. On
the fourth he had a diaphoretic medicine, and his drinks
were acidulated with spirit of vitriol. The symptoms
increasing, sinapisms were applied to the feet, but without
effect. Cataplasms of garlic were applied next
night; he had two copious black stools, not very fœtid,
and two bilious ones in the morning of the sixth. By
these stools he was greatly weakened, and was ordered a
cordial with diascordium. He had another stool, and
became much worse. Cataplasms were applied without
effect, and he died on the seventh day. This patient
had a great number of eruptions; but, though six people
attended him constantly, none of them were infected.</p>

<p>8. A Jewish girl of nine years old, of a delicate frame,
and sprightly disposition, was visited on the 4th day.
The usual regimen and medicines were ordered, but she
could not be prevailed on to take any thing besides an
acidulated cordial. Palm-oil was externally applied to
a carbuncle near the corner of the mouth, about an inch
long, and the third of an inch broad. This seemed to
ease the pain, but did not prevent it from spreading.
The face was also strangely disfigured by three or four
streaks of a pale red colour, shooting up on each side
from the cheeks towards the temples. The gangrene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
spread rapidly, and she died on the evening of the tenth
day.</p>

<p>9. A stout, healthy Armenian youth, about 20, was
visited on the first day, and took a vomit of ipecacuanha,
which brought up a good deal of bile. An anodyne was
given at night, but without effect. He took no medicines
afterwards but an acidulated cordial. On the
third he eat a quantity of cherries, and drank some iced
water. He died on the fourth. Here the infection
spread violently, only one out of six in the same house
escaping the disease. Three died.</p>

<p>10. An Armenian woman in the seventh month of
her pregnancy. She was bled the first day, had afterwards
diaphoretic boluses, but did not sweat. On the
third day she was delivered of a dead child, and seemed
much better, but died at night. After death the body
was entirely covered with purple marks.</p>

<p>11. A boy was bled and had an alexipharmic mixture
the first day. A diarrhœa came on, and diascordium
was added to the mixture without success. He died
the third night. The infection was violent, only one
in the house escaping.</p>

<p>12. A Jew of middle age and gross habit of body
was bled on the second day. He was visited on the
fifth, had diaphoretic powders, and sinapisms were ordered
without success. He died on the 6th.</p>

<p>13. A Christian youth of 17, taken suddenly, was visited
on the second day. A cataplasm was applied to the
groin; he had a vomit of ipecacuan, and a diaphoretic
draught with nitre and diascordium at night, but did
not sweat. Next day he had acidulated drinks, a mixture
with sweet spirit of nitre, and a small proportion of
nitre itself. On the fourth, he had two stools, of a
reddish colour like blood, after which he became
much worse. In the night he had two other stools,
which seemed to lower him. Throughout the day a
larger portion of nitre had been added to his mixture,
and three tea-cupfuls of blood were taken away, without
the Doctor’s knowledge, by cupping. On the fifth
the nitre was omitted; he was ordered an astringent cordial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
but it was not given; however, the diaphoretic
medicines were continued, and he had three loose stools,
which sunk him greatly. Next day he seemed past recovery;
lying motionless, insensible, his breathing quick,
laborious and interrupted; the skin not cold, but the
feverish heat gone, and his countenance ghastly. From
this lethargic state the women attempted frequently to
rouse him, by applying vinegar to his nostrils, calling
him loudly by his name, and such like means, by which
they sometimes succeeded; but, though he opened his
eyes, and gave signs of sense, he could not be prevailed
on to drink; and he remained silent. He would then,
for some time, writhe his body as in mortal agony, and
again relapse into lethargy. This dreadful paroxysm,
however, began to wear off about noon; and at night
he was less disturbed than usual. On the seventh day
he was manifestly better; he had a looseness, with gripes,
for which the white decoction was ordered; and he had
tincture of bark thrice in twenty-four hours. On the
sixteenth day the fever was entirely gone. The Doctor
observes that this patient sweated much less than was
usual with those who recovered.</p>

<p>14. A Christian boy about 17 was visited on the
4th day, having taken some absorbent powders on the
2d from another physician. The family would allow
no other medicines to be given, except a few grains of
bezoar, and he died next day.</p>

<p>15. An Italian, a man about 40, of a gross habit of
body, and addicted to drinking, but who, finding himself
somewhat indisposed, had for two or three days lived
temperately, was visited on the second day of his illness,
had a diaphoretic mixture, and a laxative medicine,
without relief. In the night between the 5th and 6th
he had some retchings to vomit. Next day he complained
of a pain at the pit of the stomach, had a vomit
of ipecacuanha, which brought off a considerable quantity
of bile by vomit and stool, but without any apparent
relief. He had two fœtid stools, and was ordered
a cordial with volatiles. On the 7th his pulse was exceedingly
sunk, and his extremities had been as cold as ice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
but with very little alteration in the eyes or countenance.
The patient did not know that these parts had lost their
heat; and, notwithstanding this change, the sensation
still remained in them. He died on the afternoon of
the 8th day. This patient had no eruptions.</p>

<p>16. A Christian merchant about 50, of an atrabilious
habit, and subject to the hæmorrhoids, on being taken
ill drank immoderately of cold water. He was visited
next day. In the afternoon about ten ounces of blood
were taken away, and, as his pulse rose after the operation,
he lost, by Dr. Russel’s order, six ounces more.
Three ounces were afterwards taken away by cupping,
and about as much more was accidentally lost by the
loosening of the bandage of the arm; so that about 24
ounces were taken away in all. Next day he got a few
drops of Carmelite water, a kind of spiritous cordial,
which he vomited, had a blister and sinapisms applied,
and died between 10 and 11 at night. He had no
eruptions.</p>

<p>17. An Armenian youth was visited on the morning
of the third day, was bled, and had a saline draught
every four or five hours. On the fifth he was removed
into a more airy chamber, and had Huxham’s tincture
of the bark. He died on the ninth day.</p>

<p>18. A young lady of French extraction, of a thin,
slender make, was visited on the morning of the second
day. On the third she had diaphoretic powders, and
lost a few ounces of blood by cupping, without the
Doctor’s knowledge; she had a diaphoretic mixture,
and died on the sixth day.</p>

<p>From these accounts it is easy to see, that, in violent
cases of the plague, medicine can do little or nothing.
Such cases generally occur in the earlier months of the
season, though they may take place, and do take place
in great numbers, at any time. In the beginning of
the season the patients are almost all attacked in this
violent manner, and very seldom recover, whether they
take medicines or not. It being then an established
fact, that as the epidemic season advances the disease
grows milder, and many more continue to recover of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
themselves than did so at first, we are naturally led to
suppose that a multitude of those who recovered after
taking the medicines would have done the same without
them. Little therefore needs be said of the immense
number of prescriptions found in authors who have
written upon the plague, as it may generally be supposed
that at certain times these would have been ineffectual,
and at others they were useless.&mdash;The following is
an epitome of Dr. Patrick Russel’s practice:</p>

<p>1. Bleeding as early as possible, seldom repeated,
except where manifestly indicated by circumstances.</p>

<p>2. Vomiting, if spontaneous, was encouraged by warm
water. If the patient was affected by nausea, vomiting
was provoked by warm water or camomile tea, assisted
by a feather. If a bitter taste in the mouth was complained
of, ten or fifteen grains of ipecacuanha were
given. The times of remission were laid hold of for
those remedies.</p>

<p>3. Where spontaneous vomiting continued too long,
a saline mixture was given, sometimes with opiates and
external applications.</p>

<p>4. The stomach being settled, mild sudorifics were
given in small doses, every five or six hours. In the
beginning, nitre was joined with contrayerva, but where
it occasioned loose stools, was left off. Spiritus mindereri
and saline mixture were also given as sudorifics.</p>

<p>5. In case of diarrhœa, dilution was first prescribed
and then the white decoction. Laxative medicines
were seldom admitted by the friends of the patient.
Diascordium and opiates were used in cases of obstinate
diarrhœa.</p>

<p>6. In the advance of the distemper it was found more
eligible to give the sudorifics at shorter intervals, when
occasion required, than to augment the dose, which was
apt to occasion disgust, and a rejection of medicine entirely;
consequences which also attended an attempt to
heighten the power of the medicines themselves. The
general design was to make their operation coincide with
the periodical determination to the skin naturally occurring
in the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>7. The sudorifics exhibited having but small power
by themselves, it was found necessary to assist them by
dilution, as well as in every other method which could
be attempted. If the patient was not naturally inclined
to drink, he was encouraged to it by offering agreeable
liquids, either hot or cold at the person’s option.</p>

<p>8. The diet was the same as in other acute distempers.
No animal food stronger than chicken broth was allowed;
the rest confided of farinacea and leguminous vegetables.
“It was certainly necessary (says our author) to a certain
degree, to support nature by proper food; but to
force it upon a nauseating stomach seems to have been
irrationally recommended; and, where attempted,
which the over care of the nurses frequently did, usually
excited vomiting. I sometimes wished to give
wine, but a religious bar lay in the way of Mahommedans,
and a prejudice against it, in all fevers, rendered
it equally inadmissible among the Christians and Jews.”</p>

<p>9. For oppression at the præcordia, mild cordials, acidulated
drinks and cool air were found useful. Throughout
the disease access of cool air to the chamber was
constantly allowed, and, where the chamber itself was not
sufficiently airy, the bed was removed to the house top.
Towards the height of the exacerbations, however, when
there happened to be the least appearance of moisture on
the skin, the sick were kept moderately covered up from
the chin downward.</p>

<p>10. After the height, and through the decline of the
disease, the bark in substance, or Huxham’s tincture,
were given instead of the ordinary sudorifics.</p>

<p>In the plague which took place in the Russian army,
the greatest confidence seems to have been put in vomits.
The disease commonly began with a dull pain in the

accompanied with shivering, universal weakness,
&amp;c<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> On the first appearance of these a vomit was given,
working it off with acid drinks. “If the nausea
and bitter taste in the mouth was not removed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
the first, they gave a second, and sometimes a third or
fourth; nay, they sometimes, if the symptoms were
very urgent, gave two or three in the space of twelve
hours, as there is no time to be lost in this disease; for
they did not find this species of evacuation subject to
the same inconvenience with purges, which a man in
the plague is unable to support; nay, they are even
dangerous, though he bears brisk vomits, and a repetition
of them, when the nature of the case requires it.</p>

<p>“The stomach being thus cleansed, they gave every
morning a powder composed of twenty grains of rhubarb,
mixed with as much flower of brimstone, and
three grains of ipecacuanha, exhibiting also, every
hour, five grains of pure nitre mixed with two grains
of camphor; and, if costive, a laxative clyster was
given every evening, composed of decoction of camomile,
wine vinegar, with or without soap, according
to circumstances.</p>

<p>“The head, temples and buboes were frequently
washed with warm vinegar, and the last urged to suppuration
with emollient cataplasms; but, in case they
were found to baffle all attempts to bring them forward,
they were then scarified or extirpated, and the
patient ordered to drink plentifully of <i>lime-water</i>.
Bark was given after evacuation, joined to the flower
of brimstone in the proportion of one ounce of the
former to a drachm of the latter, divided into sixteen
powders, and taken in twenty-four hours. When delirium
came on, blisters were applied to the legs and
arms, and camphor given largely. Vegetable and
mineral acids were given indiscriminately; but they
found the vegetable kind sometimes remain on the
stomach when the other was thrown up; and of the
latter they preferred the vitriolic. Acidulated drinks
were given in quantity through the whole disease, and
the food consisted of acidulated water-gruel, and fruit
when they could procure any. The air of the room
was kept charged with acetous vapours, as much as
possible, and it was remarked, that, while the bitter
taste remained, there was little hope of the disease
abating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

<p>According to Baron Ash, “the plague does not depend
upon any constitution of the air, but is communicated
only by contact, and they had repeatedly
succeeded in suppressing it in different divisions of the
army, by the immediate separation of the infected
with their attendants, and burning every thing belonging
to them, or that they had touched. They
found the greatest advantage in keeping the soldiers
ignorant of its existence till suppressed; for by this
means they preserved their peace of mind, and health
of body; and they found an exact military discipline
the best preservative against the disease. For the cure
of those infected they found the cold regimen, a free
circulation of air, vegetable and mineral acids, ipecacuanha,
rhubarb and bark, to be the properest remedies.
That, to purify the air in hospitals appropriated
for their reception, gun-powder was found most efficacious,
probably from the commotion given to the
air in explosion, over and above its action in common
with other fumes. To resist infection, courage and
fortitude of mind is necessary, as consternation and
terror seem to prepare the body for the reception of
the disease.”</p>

<p>Dr. Sydenham seemed to have as great an opinion of
bleeding, as the Russian physicians of vomits. Considering
the plague as merely inflammatory, he lays the
whole strength of the cure upon bleeding, which he
greatly prefers to any other remedy. The quantities he
took away were very considerable; and he gives an
instance of a patient who died from not having enough
taken away. He also informs us, that, during the civil
wars in England, the plague raged in several places.
Being accidentally brought to Dunstar castle in Somersetshire,
a surgeon, who had travelled much in foreign
parts, applied for leave to give the garrison what assistance
he could. This being granted, he bled them,
every man as he stood, without distinction, till ready to
drop down; the blood was suffered to flow down upon
the ground, so that no account could be taken of the
quantity. They were then ordered to lie in their tents;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
and, though no kind of remedy was given after bleeding,
every one recovered<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> Notwithstanding his opinion of
bleeding, however, this celebrated physician was obliged
to attempt the cure by sweating, which he says he preferred
to bleeding on account of its not weakening the
patient so much, nor hazarding the reputation of the
physician; yet he says it is prejudicial in young people
where the powers of life are strong. His improved
method therefore was, first to bleed moderately, if no
swelling had appeared, by which means a sweat would
be more safely and easily raised. The bleeding is to be
performed in bed, after which the patient must be
covered up with the bed-clothes, and a piece of flanel
applied to the forehead. This last expedient, he says,
contributes more to the raising of a sweat than one
would imagine. If no vomiting ensued, he administered
sudorific medicines internally. But, if the stomach
cannot retain any thing, he proposes to begin the
sweating merely by the weight of the clothes, and now
and then throwing part of the sheet over the face. The
sweat being thus begun, the vomiting, however violent,
generally stops, and the medicines will be retained, so
that as plentiful a perspiration as we can desire may be
excited. An instance of his success in this way he gives
in an apothecary who applied to him in behalf of his
brother. A sweat being proposed, the apothecary told
him that he had given him several strong sudorifics, all
of which had been thrown up; but the Doctor, having
first sweated him moderately by the bed-clothes, afterwards
gave him a large dose of Venice treacle; which
operating powerfully, he recovered from the disease.
He advises the sweat to be kept up without intermission
for twenty-four hours; a smaller time being insufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
to remove the disease, and a stoppage of the perspiration
certainly attended with a return of the bad symptoms.
On this occasion he censures Diemerbroeck and others
for advising to stop the sweat on every slight occasion.
The linen is to be allowed to dry on the patient’s body,
he must take all his liquids warm, and continue the use
of a diluting fluid. Sage posset drink is what he recommends.
Next morning the cure was finished by a
purge of senna, tamarinds, &amp;c. Where a swelling appears,
he directs to forbear bleeding even in such as are
not apt to sweat, least the patient should die suddenly
from a return of the morbific matter into the vessels.
Bleeding, however, might be used with safety even in
this case, provided a sweat was instantly to be raised;
and thus he thinks the swelling might be dispersed perhaps
with more safety than by waiting for its suppuration.</p>

<p>This may be accounted an epitome of the most approved
modern practice in pestilential cases. The Russian
physicians above quoted seem to speak with most
confidence of their success. They, however, “lay great
stress upon distinguishing the plague from the worst
kind of malignant fever in hot countries; and it is
not without reason, as bad consequences have attended
the confounding of them on the breaking out of the
plague. I am credibly informed that the great havock
made in Moscow was principally owing to this circumstance;
for it obtained some time before it was
discovered by gentlemen unacquainted with the disease,
and before they would acknowledge its existence,
although some veteran army practitioners recognised
its appearance under one of its forms, and endeavoured
to alarm their brethren, but in vain, for a
time.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span></p>

<p>From this it is natural to conclude, that, when the
disease was once fairly discovered and attacked by the
powers of medicine, it could not make much resistance;
yet Dr. Mertens, speaking of this very plague, says, that
owing to the rapidity of the distemper, and many inducements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
to conceal it, <i>little can be said of remedies</i> in
the plague. He divides the distemper into two kinds,
the nervous and putrid; the former “comprehending
merely that degree of confusion and disturbance given
to the nervous system on the first introduction of the
miasma, and the latter commencing at the time the
miasma begins to operate upon the blood and other
fluids by assimilating them to their own putrid nature.”
In the nervous state the miasma has sometimes
been carried off by sweat, gentle diaphoretics,
camphorated emulsions, juleps of camphor and musk.
Gentle emetics, particularly ipecacuanha, were found
useful; but James’s powder (which was imported from
England in great quantity) did not answer any good
purpose. In the putrid state, the bark and mineral
acids were useful; purgatives were hurtful, blood-letting
inadvisable, and scarifying the carbuncles, recommended
by almost every writer, attended with no good
effect.</p>

<p>Few of the modern travellers who have visited the
countries in which the plague is frequent, being versed
in medicine, have said much about the cure of it. Mariti
only says, that, in the island of Cyprus, infected patients
were allowed no other diet than pure water, panada,
rice, tea, &amp;c. Some thought to ward off the disease by
drinking strong liquors, but these <i>almost always</i> fell victims
to it. Whatever their methods were, indeed, they must
certainly have been very ineffectual, since the same author
informs us that, in the plague of 1759, in many parts
of that island there were not a sufficiency of inhabitants
left to cultivate the ground.</p>

<p>Diemerbroeck, whose name justly ranks high among
those who have written on the plague, trusts mostly to
sudorific medicines. Bleeding, according to him, is
absolutely to be avoided, as well as purging and vomiting.
He directed first that the chambers of the sick
should be kept clean, and the air purified three or four
times a day by fumigations, and that the sick should
take (in the beginning, the first, second, or third day)
a <i>sweating draught</i>, and being well covered with blankets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
plentiful sweats were promoted for two or three hours or
more (always having a regard to the patient’s strength.)
If the patient did not sweat easily, bags filled with hot,
dry sand were applied to the feet, armpits and groin.
If the sick were not eased by the first sweat, it was
repeated in a few hours; but if, after the second
sweat, the fever and other symptoms still increased, it
was the worst sign. After ten or twelve hours, and
on the following days, they were repeated four or five
times as occasion required. Besides this he directed apozems,
antidotes, &amp;c. which, as it is most probable they
had no effect in removing the disease, it is needless to
trouble the reader with<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>
<p>That a free perspiration is the natural cure of the
plague, seems to be allowed by almost all writers of credit.
Dr. Russel says, “Of all excretions, <i>that</i> by the skin
would seem to be the most materially important in
the plague. Where the skin remains perpetually dry,
or where short and precipitate sweats are attended
with no favourable alteration, danger is always to be
apprehended. On the other hand, sweats, at certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
periods of the disease, appeared clearly critical in a
greater or less degree. They were followed by a
manifest alteration for the better, and by their repetition
the fever was carried entirely off, or reduced to
symptomatic exacerbations, seemingly dependent on
the eruptions.” He adds, that he never observed
blood exude through the pores, nor did he observe the
sweat to be remarkably offensive; or in any degree so
remarkable as in some eruptive fevers, particularly in the
small-pox before eruption. Dr. Hodges, however, says
that in the plague of London sweats were sometimes extremely
acrid and fœtid; and that they were met with
of various colours, such as purple, green, black, or blood-coloured.
Sometimes it was cold, though the patient
was tormented with intolerable inward heat and drought;
and would continue even after death; but he was of
opinion that sweat is the natural crisis of the distemper.</p>

<p>Besides those symptoms of the plague which have been
enumerated, there are others, particularly hæmorrhages
and convulsions, with which it is sometimes attended.
These it has in common with the yellow fever, and
therefore are considered in the second part of the work.
I now conclude this part with a short retrospect of the
principal facts which to me seem to be the result of the
investigation. 1. That the plague is of an unknown
(I believe it of <i>divine</i>) original. 2. That in the countries
on which it first was sent, it still remains, and from
them has always been propagated to others, without a single
well attested instance to the contrary. 3. That the
means by which the distemper usually has been propagated
are <i>war</i> and <i>commerce</i>. 4. That the disease differs from all
others in having a more violent tendency to inflammation,
insomuch that it approaches to actual accension;
nay, that the extraordinary instances of spontaneous
burning we read of are to be accounted only the
highest degree of this disease. 5. That the immediate
or proximate cause of the plague is a tendency in the
blood and other fluids to discharge upon certain parts
the latent heat they contain, in such quantity as to destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
these parts entirely, and to convert them into a
kind of coaly substance. 6. That this tendency depends
on a certain inexplicable action of the external
atmosphere, particularly of the elementary fire contained
in it, and of which it principally consists<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> 7. The approach
of a plague cannot be foretold, either from the
constitution of the atmosphere, earthquakes, storms, or
any other natural phenomena. 8. The plague is an
eruptive disease, and it is known to be so by the <i>certain
death</i> of all in whom eruptions do not appear; a tendency
to eruption being <i>always</i> observed where life remained
long enough. 9. The contagion of the plague diffuses
itself from a small space all around, lessening in violence
the farther it is diffused. In its most concentrated state it
hath proved invincible by medicine; in its mild state it
requires none<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> so that in the plague the medical powers
are found of less avail than in any other acute distemper.
10. The natural cure of the plague is by perspiration or
sweat, and this perhaps is the only evacuation which
ought to be kept in view, as having a salutary tendency,
by those who attend the sick<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span></p>

<p class="pl1hi1">We now come to treat of a disease, less fatal indeed
than the Asiatic plague, but yet so deadly in its nature
in the Western World, that it has of late been confounded
with the former, and attempts made to prove
that they are both to be considered only as degrees
of the same disease, and that both have been recorded
by historians indiscriminately under the common

this matter candidly, and to show that there is
a real and essential difference between the two, as
far as we can credit testimonies drawn from the most
respectable writers, shall be the work of the following
part of this treatise.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_Iy">SECTION I.</h3>
</div>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>History of the Yellow Fever.</i></p>


<p>The distemper now under consideration has been
commonly distinguished by two different names;
one of which is the <i>Yellow Fever</i>, the other the <i>Black
Vomit</i>. Both of these are taken from symptoms so remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
(though not occurring in every case) that,
had the disease existed in ancient times, we can scarce
think but some of the historians of antiquity would have
taken notice that in such a plague those who died generally
became yellow, or that they had a continual vomiting
of black matter, which could not be stopped.
Black or bilious vomitings are indeed mentioned, though
not as the principal symptom, but the yellow colour is
not once taken notice of. Dr. Hodges indeed mentions
a single instance of a patient who became all over
of a <i>green</i> colour; but as a change of colour is not taken
notice of in the plague as a general symptom, either by
him or by any other writer, we must conclude that this
distemper (the yellow fever) has been observed only in
modern times.</p>

<p>When Columbus first visited the West India islands,
we hear nothing of his having found such a disease existing
there; nor does it appear that it was known
among the many Spanish adventurers who succeeded
him, and who subdued such immense tracts on the
Southern Continent. Soon after the settlement of some
of the West India islands, however, by other European
nations, this disease began to make its appearance,
though at what time is still uncertain. Dr. Hillary
says, that, “as we have no accounts of this disease in the
ancients, nor even in the Arabian writers, who lived and
practised in the hot climate, we must give it <i>some name</i>;”
and he calls it the <i>putrid bilious fever</i>. “From the best
and most authentic account (adds he) that I can obtain,
as also from the nature and symptoms of the
disease, it appears to be a disease that is <span class="nowrap">indigenous<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span>
to the West India islands and the continent of America
which is situated between the tropics, and most
probably to all other countries within the torrid zone.
But I cannot conceive what were the motives which
induced Dr. Warren to think that this fever was first
brought from Palestine to Marseilles, and from thence
to Martinique, and so to Barbadoes, about thirty-seven
years since (1721 or 1722.) A better inquiry would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
have informed him, that this fever had frequently appeared,
in this and the other West India islands, many
years before: for several judicious practitioners, who
were then, and are now, living here, whose business
was, visiting the sick the greatest part of their life
time, some of them almost eighty years of age, remember
to have seen this fever frequently in this island,
not only many years before that time, but many years
before that learned gentleman came to it.”</p>

<p>To the same purpose Dr. Mosely says, “Warren,
though he lived at Barbadoes in 1739, supposes it never
appeared in that island till about the year 1721, and
that it was then brought from Martinique in the Lynn
man of war. He says the second appearance of it
there was in 1733, and that it then came also from
Martinique. He undertakes to show, that it is a
disease of Asiatic extract; and says, that a <i>Provencale</i>
fleet arrived at Port St. Pierre in Martinique, from
Marseilles, on board which were several bales of Levant
goods which were taken in at Marseilles from a
ship just arrived from St. Jean D’Acre (probably the
Ptolemais of the ancients.) Upon opening these bales
of goods at Port St. Pierre, this distemper immediately
shewed itself; many of the people were instantly seized,
some died almost suddenly, others in a few days,
and some lingered longer; and the contagion, still
spreading, made great havock at the beginning. He
says he had this account from Mr. Nelson, an English
surgeon, who was seized with the disease at Martinique,
and died of it a few days after his arrival at Barbadoes.
He says, it is very probable that the same
fever, or one of very near resemblance and affinity,
may first have been carried among the American Spaniards
(among whom it is now endemic) in somewhat
a like manner; and that possibly some peculiar qualities
in the air and climate might have fostered and
maintained it there ever since.”</p>

<p>Dr. Mosely at once concludes the whole of this account
to be <i>fabulous</i>, but whether fabricated by Dr.
Warren or the surgeon, he does not say. He then appeals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
to Dr. Towne, who wrote before Warren, in
1776, but takes no notice of this <i>chimerical</i> origin of the
yellow fever, but considers it as an endemical disease in
the West Indies. Hillary’s opinion already given is also
quoted.</p>

<p>The next evidence is that of Mr. Hughes, who, though
not a medical man, has written on the first appearance
of the yellow fever in Barbadoes in the following terms:
Dr. <i>Gamble</i> remembers that it was very “fatal here in
the year 1691, and that it was then called the <i>new distemper</i>,
and afterwards <i>Kendal’s fever</i>, the <i>pestilential fever</i>,
and the <i>bilious fever</i>. The same symptoms did
not always appear in all patients, nor alike in every
year when it visited us. It is most commonly rife and
fatal in May, June, July and August, and then mostly
among strangers; though a great many of the inhabitants,
in the year 1696, died of it; and a great many
at different periods since.”</p>

<p>As to the first appearance of the disease in the West
India islands we have no accounts which have been
deemed sufficiently authentic, though indeed it must be
confessed that the doubts seem to be derived as much
from an attachment to theory as to the investigation of
truth. “The <i>endemial causus</i>, or <i>yellow fever</i>, (says Dr.
Mosely) which is the terror of Europeans newly arrived
in the West Indies, is called by the French <i>la maladie
de Siam</i>. Monsieur Pouppe Desportes, who practised
physic at <i>St. Dominique</i> from 1732 to 1748, and who
had more experience, and has written from better information
on the diseases of that colony, than any of
his countrymen, says that this fever was so called from
its being first taken notice of in the island of Martinique
at a time when some vessels were there from
Siam. This account, though probably true enough
as to the time of its being first observed in the French
colonies, is extremely incorrect in other respects: for
M. Desportes has not only admitted a supposition that
the disease originated among these East Indian mariners,
but calls it pestilential, and says that the Europeans
are almost the only victims to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>“The generality of the French writers say that it was
brought directly from Siam, in a merchant ship, and
communicated to the people of Martinique, whence
the contagion was carried to St. Dominique, but that
sailors were the only people attacked by it, whence it
was called <i>la fievre matelotte</i>.”</p>

<p>This account seems to carry no improbability in it;
nevertheless Dr. Mosely rejects it upon grounds that are
very far from being indisputable. “The French writers
(says he) have not been at the trouble to consider
that a disease brought from Siam in the East Indies, in
a similar latitude to the West India islands, would be
most likely to affect the natives, living in a climate
similar to that in which the disease originated, rather
than the Europeans of so different a temperament of
body.” But this argument would prove too much;
for if the disease would be most likely to affect the natives
in a climate <i>similar</i> to that in which the disease originated,
surely it would be still more likely to attack the
natives in <i>that very climate</i> in which the disease did originate,
and that Europeans would be free. But the very
reverse is the case. The disease, according to Dr. Moseley
himself, originates in the West Indies; and yet Europeans,
especially those newly arrived, are particularly
objects of its vengeance.</p>

<p>“But (adds our author) the fact is, that this disease
never attacks either white or black natives of hot
climates; neither was it brought from Siam; and
though it is possible, from the heat of the climate, that
it may frequently appear there, or in any other tropical
country (though <span class="smcap">Barrere</span> says it is unknown
at <i>Cayenne</i>) no history of that country that I have yet
met with mentions such a disease; notwithstanding
what many writers have boldly advanced to the contrary.”</p>

<p>Here it is evident we have no argument, but a parcel
of assertions, the first of which contradicts what he
had just before quoted from Mr. Hughes. For the
latter informs us that in 1696 a great many of the
<i>inhabitants</i> died of it as well as strangers. His not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
meeting with it in any history of Siam is not a proof of
its non-existence in the country, neither indeed does he
himself think that it is so, as he tells us that it may possibly
appear there, or in any other tropical country.</p>

<p>In Sauvages’s Nosology we find the plague distinguished
into a number of different species, among which there is
one called the <i>plague of Siam</i>. This, he says, was in the
year 1685 brought from Siam to Martinico, in the ship
called the <i>Oriflame</i>. This seems to have been the <i>yellow
fever</i>, and the symptoms are considered in the following
section. This date agrees exactly with what Mr.
Hughes says in the place above quoted, that it was violent
in Barbadoes in the year 1691, when it went by the
names of the <i>new fever</i>, and <i>Kendal’s fever</i>. Both these
names imply that the disease had been but lately known,
and that it was by no means a native of the climate.
It must either have been <i>imported</i> therefore from some
other country, or it must have <i>originated</i> in consequence
of the settlement of some Europeans in a climate so
dissimilar to their own, while some of them still continued
to ramble from one country to another, occasionally visiting
all, without taking up their residence in any.</p>

<p>Martinique seems to have been the first place where
this distemper made its appearance; and from thence
it seems quickly to have extended itself to St. Domingo
and Barbadoes. Its farther progress, however, cannot
be traced, nor can we tell exactly what time it first
entered the continent. Whether the true plague was
ever imported into the Western Continent cannot at
present be ascertained, neither can we tell what diseases
the Indians were subject to before the arrival of the Europeans.
The Spaniards, who first arrived, are allowed
to have been less subject to the plague than other nations<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span>
but they were quickly followed by those who had
no such exemption. Sebastian Cabot discovered the
North American Continent for Henry VII of England,
very soon after, if not before Columbus discovered the
Southern Continent for the king of Spain. This was
a very suspicious time; for Henry VII himself had introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
the sweating sickness into England only thirteen
years before<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> and in those days the plague seems
never to have been eradicated; so that it is by no means
impossible that these first adventurers might have communicated
to the Indians with whom they had any
communication, the seeds of diseases totally unknown to
them before. Certain it is, that the North American
Indians were subject to epidemics before the settlement
of any English colonies among them. Hutchinson in
his History of Massachusetts takes notice of the Indians
having been greatly weakened by an epidemic, which
was attributed to an unfavourable season, in consequence
of which they were obliged to feed upon unripe squashes,
fruits, &amp;c. We know not the nature of the distemper,
though, from the circumstance just mentioned, we
may not unreasonably conjecture it to have been of the
pestilential kind. That epidemics still continue among
these people we also know from the testimony of Capt.
Carver, who found one of their towns deserted, and the
inhabitants fled into the woods, on account of an epidemic
disorder; but what the nature of it was he does not
inform us<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>Mr. Webster, in his eighth letter to Dr. Currie on
the subject of pestilential diseases, quotes from the
Doctor’s letter to Mr. Wynkoop, of October 5th, 1797,
the following passages: “Thomas Story and Joseph
Gough relate, that a malignant fever prevailed in
Philadelphia in 1699, introduced from the West
India islands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dr. Mitchill ascribes the yellow
fever as it appeared in Virginia in 1741 and 47 to
specific contagion, and mentions that it had been
twice imported into Virginia by his Majesty’s ships of
war. Dr. <i>Leamy</i> (<i>Lining</i>) in the Physical Essays in
Edinburgh, informs us, that the yellow fever which
has prevailed at different periods at Charleston, South
Carolina, was always traced to some infected person
recently from the West Indies. In 1741 it was introduced
by a chest of wearing apparel which had belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
to a person who died of it from Barbadoes.”
These quotations are made by Mr. Webster with a
view to dispute the contagious nature of the disease.
Here they are introduced only to show if possible the
time that the disease first entered the United States;
and the introduction of it into Philadelphia in 1699
(though we are not sure if even this was its first appearance),
still corresponds extremely well with the date of its
introduction into Martinique mentioned by Sauvages.
Dr. Lining says it had been four times epidemic in
Charleston before the time that he wrote; viz. in 1732,
1739, 1745, and 1748. Hence we may conclude, that
this fever, on the northern part of the continent of
America, has been nearly coeval with the settlement of
the British colonies there; for we cannot suppose that
we have accounts of the very first time that it made its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
appearance any where. Numbers of individuals would
probably be affected with it, and their cases pass unnoticed,
till the general malady attracted the public attention.</p>

<p>In the Spanish dominions it seems to have been otherwise.
Dr. Moseley quotes Don Ulloa saying that “the
<i>vomito prieto</i>, or black vomit, was unknown at Carthagena,
and all along the coast, till the years 1729 and
1730. In 1729 Don Domingo Justiniani, commodore
of the guarda costas, lost so considerable a part of his
ships’ companies at <i>Santa Martha</i>, that the survivors
were struck with astonishment and horror at the
havock made among their comrades. In 1730, when
the galleons under Don Manuel Lopez Pintado came
to Carthagena, the seamen were seized with the same
dreadful mortality, and so sudden were the attacks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the disease, that persons, walking about one day, were
the next carried to their graves. Unhappily, after all
the experiments of the surgeons of the galleons, and
physicians of the country, no good method of treating
the disease has been discovered; no specific for
curing it.”</p>

<p>This fatal disease, however common in the southern
and warm part of the continent of America, seems not
to have exerted its power in the more northern and
temperate climates till the year 1793. Since that time
its ravages have been too well known to require an
enumeration here. To describe the symptoms, inquire
into the causes, and the means of prevention and cure,
is a work of more importance, and to this we must
now proceed.</p>

as it has appeared in various parts of the United States

the Yellow Fever is Contagious or not.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap">O<span class="ls01em">F</span> all those who have attempted to give an account
of this fatal disease, none appear to have exceeded
Dr. Moseley, either in his accuracy in enumeration, or
perspicuity in description, of the symptoms. According
to him the yellow fever is a species of the <i>kausos</i> of Hippocrates,
Aretœus and Galen; that is, the <i>febris ardens</i> or
<i>causus</i>, aggravated by climate, incidental only to the gross,
inflammatory and plethoric at any season of the year, totally
different from the remitting bilious fever to which
all habits of body are subject in hot climates, particularly
after rains, and in the fall of the year. The causus,
seldom seen in the temperate climates of Europe, never
appears there with the violent symptoms which attend it
in hot climates. “Whether in the latitudes (says he) so
mild as those of Spain, Greece, Italy and the Archipelagan
islands, the causus has ever been attended with
black vomiting, as in the West-Indies, I cannot tell.
Lommius mentions the vomiting of blood, and voiding
black liquid stools and black urine. Critical and
symptomatical yellowness of the skin in the causus are
enumerated by Hippocrates among its symptoms, and
Lommius mentions the danger of that appearance before
the seventh day. The affinity of the symptoms,
progress and termination of a causus in Europe to
those of the yellow fever in the West-Indies, excepting
the black vomiting, leaves no room to doubt that the
difference of climate constitutes all the difference that
is found between them.”</p>

<p>For these reasons Dr. Moseley adopts the name of <i>endemial
causus</i>; and he takes notice that many difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
have arisen to young practitioners, and to strangers
in the West-Indies, from the various names improperly
given to it from its ultimate and not from its primary
symptoms. Some call it a <i>burning</i> bilious fever; Warren,
a <i>putrid</i> bilious fever; but, though they have disputed
about their terms, Dr. Moseley thinks that neither
of them have proved whether bile be the cause or the
effect of the disease. To call it the black vomit or the
yellow fever, he thinks also improper, as a stranger would
not know the disease until some of these symptoms appear;
both of which are generally fatal, and neither of them
constant.</p>

<p>The West-India causus he says is no more putrid than
the small-pox, or any other acute disease; which may,
after it has passed its inflammatory state, change to putrefaction,
and end in death with an extraordinary dissolution
of the fluids. The disease is in truth an inflammatory
one in the highest degree possible; accompanied
with such symptoms in a greater extent as attend all inflammatory
fevers, and most strikingly the reverse of any
disease that is putrid, or of one exacerbation. It obeys
no season of the year, and attacks such people, and under
such circumstances, as are seldom the objects of putrid
diseases, viz. all who are of an inflammatory diathesis,
and do not perspire freely.</p>

<p>This distemper attacks sailors in the West-Indies
more than any other set of men, even of new comers.
For this the Dr. assigns as a reason, that they eat, drink,
and sleep, so much at sea, use no exercise, and are
always of gross habit of body. To this he adds the heat
and dampness of harbours, generally in the neighbourhood
of marshes, and their exposure to land winds at
night; the labour they endure on board vessels in port,
and the carelessness and excesses frequently committed by
these people after long voyages.</p>

<p>When a stranger newly arrived feels a sudden loss of
strength, with a continual desire of changing his position
without finding rest in any, we may expert a causus. If
he has exposed himself to any of the causes just mentioned,
the probable consequences would be, that on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
morrow he would feel an heaviness, lassitude, oppression
and loss of appetite<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> Next day, or perhaps within
twelve hours from the first indisposition, the violence of
the disease commences with faintness, generally giddiness
of the head, with a small degree of chillness and
horror, but never any rigor. These symptoms are succeeded
by a high fever, great heat, and strong beatings
of the arteries, particularly those of the temples and carotids;
flushings of the face, gasping for cool air; tongue
white tinged with yellow, after the retchings have commenced;
excessive thirst; redness, heaviness, and sensations
of burning in the eyes; heaviness and darting pains
in the head, small of the back, and often down the
thighs; the pulse generally full and strong, but sometimes
quick, low, and vacillating; the skin hot and dry,
though sometimes it has a partial and momentary moisture.
There is a sickness of stomach from the beginning;
retchings succeed immediately after any liquid is
swallowed, which bring up bilious matter. There is an
anxiety with stricture, soreness, and intense heat about
the præcordia; great restlessness, heavy respiration, sighing,
urine deep coloured and in small quantity.</p>

<p>Thus the fever goes on during its first stage, which
constitutes the inflammatory period, and continues from
twenty-four to sixty hours. The second, which our author
calls the <i>metaptosis</i>, is comparatively mild, and is an
intermediate state between the inflammatory and gangrenous
stages. In this there is an abatement of many of
the former symptoms, and a kind of deceitful tranquillity,
accompanied, however, with a perturbation, if the patient
should happen to sleep. There now appears a yellow
tinge in the eyes, neck and breast; the heat subsides,
sometimes accompanied with chillness, but never with
that kind of rigor, which, when it happens, terminates
the disease by sweat, or by copious bilious evacuations,
upwards or downwards. The retchings increase and become
porraceous: the pulse flags, but is sometimes high,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
and sometimes soft; the skin moist and clammy; urine
of a dark saffron colour, and in small quantity; the
tongue in some cases is dry, hard, and discoloured, in
others furred and moist; the head is confused, sometimes
with delirium, with a glossiness of the eyes. This
stage of the disease continues sometimes only for a few
hours, at others from twelve to forty-eight, seldom
longer, and too frequently the disease hurries on rapidly
from the first to the third stage, which is the gangrenous
or fatal state. Now the pulse sinks, intermits, and becomes
unequal, sometimes very quick; the vomiting
becomes frequent with great straining and noise. The
matter discharged is now in greater quantity, appearing
like the grounds of coffee, or of a slate colour, and the
stomach can retain nothing: the breathing is difficult,
the tongue black, the sweats cold and clammy, the eyes
yellow and sunk; there is a yellowness round the mouth
and temples, and soon after over the whole body. The
deepening of the yellow colour, with an aggravation of
the other symptoms, is a forerunner of death. There is
a deep respiration, subsultus tendinum, a convulsive
kind of sighing; the urine is quite black, and sometimes
totally suppressed. There is a death-like coldness of the
hands, feet and legs, while the heat still remains about
the stomach; the patient is delirious, and struggles to get
up in bed; he trembles, his speech falters; blood oozes
from the mouth and nostrils, sometimes from the corners
of the eyes and ears; a black bloody cruor is discharged
both by vomit and stool: livid spots appear on different
parts of the body, particularly the præcordia; hiccup,
muttering, coma, and death, follow in quick
succession.</p>

<p>The affecting case of capt. Mawhood, who died on the
fourth day of the disease, at Port-Royal in Jamaica, in
the year 1780, exhibits a dreadful picture of this disease
in its last stage. “When I entered the room, (says Dr.
Moseley) he was vomiting a black, bloody cruor, and
he was bleeding at the nose. A bloody ichor was
oozing from the corners of his eyes, and from his mouth
and gums. His face was besmeared with blood, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
with the dullness of his eyes it presented a most distressing
contrast to his natural visage. His abdomen was
swelled and inflated most prodigiously. His body was
all over of a deep yellow, interspersed with livid spots.
His hands and feet were of a livid hue. Every part of
him was cold, excepting about his heart. He had a
deep, strong hiccup, but neither delirium nor coma;
and was, at my first seeing him, as I thought, in his
perfect senses. He looked at the changed appearance
of his skin, and expressed, though he could not speak,
by his sad countenance, that he knew life was soon to
yield up her citadel, now abandoning the rest of his
body. Exhausted with vomiting, he was at last suffocated
with the blood he was endeavouring to bring
up, and expired.”</p>

<p>The symptoms just now enumerated generally take
place in those who die from the third to the seventh day
of the disease. But in this, as in other fevers, the symptoms
vary considerably according to the constitution of
the patient, and habit of the body. In some it begins
neither with chillness, faintness, nor flushings of the face.
Sometimes the pulse is much depressed and not quick;
and in sultry weather, and damp situations, where the
inflammatory state has been only of a few hours duration,
the <i>metaptosis</i> has been so rapid, that the black vomiting
and the mortified state have unexpectedly appeared, and
have ended the patient in 24, 36 or 48 hours. But our
author says that he never saw or heard of an instance of
what Lind says, that the black vomit may attack a man
when newly arrived, without any previous complaint;
or of that mentioned by the same author, viz. “an
uneasy itching sensation, commonly in the legs; and
upon pulling down the stockings, streams of thin-dissolved
blood followed, and a ghastly yellow colour quickly
diffused itself all over the body.”</p>

<p>In some cases the disease is much more mild. There
are instances where it has been protracted to the eighth,
ninth or tenth day; and others where it has never passed
from the inflammatory stage; but being checked,
though not extinguished, it has been lengthened out, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
at last converted into a remittent of great duration, most
difficult of cure, and tedious of recovery.</p>

<p>According to our author, the stomach seems to bear
the principal burden of the disease, and accordingly, after
death, appears to have been principally affected. Great
heat is perceived near the præcordia during all the stages
of the disease, and pain and uneasiness are complained
of when those parts are pressed with the hand. After
death, livid spots appear over the whole body, particularly
about the præcordia. On dissection, the stomach,
in some part or other, is generally found mortified,
especially if the black vomiting has continued long, and
the livid spots have appeared before death. Frequently
the upper part of the duodenum is in a gangrenous state,
and always bears the marks of inflammation, lest the disease
have been of ever so short a duration.</p>

<p>Though both liver and gall-bladder must be very
much affected in this disease, yet Dr. Moseley is of
opinion that nothing can be depended upon from an
inspection of them after death. Some symptoms there
are in common with inflammations of the liver, but
none of those which distinguish it from other diseases.
It never terminates in suppuration of the liver as the
hepatitis sometimes does, though it is frequently carried
off by an enormous secretion of bile. “Dissections
(says the Doctor) have never discovered any certain
and uniform appearance in the liver of those who have
died of this disease. In hot climates a sound state of the
liver is never to be expected after death, whether the
disease has been acute or chronical. Of the latter class
of diseases it is almost always either the seat, or the
origin.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lining, in a letter to Dr. Whytt at Edinburgh,
published in the Physical and Literary Essays, defines
the disease, to be “that fever, which continues two or
three days, and terminates without any critical discharge
by sweat, urine, stool, &amp;c. leaving the patient
excessively weak, with a small pulse, easily depressible
by very little motion, or by an erect posture; and
<i>which</i> is soon succeeded by an icteritious (jaundice)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
colour in the white of the eyes and the skin; vomiting,
hæmorrhages, &amp;c. and those without being accompanied
with any degree of a febrile pulse and heat.”</p>

<p>In the four times in which he mentions it to have
been epidemic at Charleston, our author says, that none
of the years (excepting 1739, the summer and autumn
of which had been remarkably rainy) were either warmer
or more rainy (and some of them less so) than the summers
and autumns were in several other years in which
there was not one instance of any one being seized with
it. The subjects were whites of both sexes, especially
strangers lately arrived from cold climates, Indians, Mistees,
Mulattoes of all ages, excepting young children,
and of those only such as had formerly escaped the infection.
Negroes were not liable to it.</p>

<p>Those affected with the fever, for a day or two previous
to the attack generally complained of head-ach,
pain in the loins and extremities, but principally in the
knees and legs, debility and lassitude; but some were
taken ill suddenly without any warning. The symptoms
were, shivering; frequent, full, hard and strong pulse;
though sometimes small and hard, and in others soft and
small; but towards the end of the fever it became smaller,
harder, and less frequent. Sometimes there was a
remarkable throbbing in the hypochondria and carotids,
the former causing in some a tremulous motion of the
whole abdomen. The heat was about 102 of Fahrenheit,
and nearly equal over the whole body; some had
frequent returns of chilliness without any diminution of
temperature of the body. “In a few there happened so
great a remission of the heat for some hours, when at the
same time the pulse was soft and less frequent, and the
skin moist, that one from these circumstances might
reasonably have hoped that the fever would only
prove a remittent or intermittent. About the end of
the second day the heat began to abate.” Here Dr.
Moseley takes notice that when the fever abates, some,
who have mistaken the <i>bilious remittent</i> for the <i>causus</i>,
speak of remissions which do not happen in this fever.
“This circumstance of the endemial causus (says he)
I believe, has never been mentioned before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>Dr. Lining goes on to inform us, that the skin was
rarely dry in this disease, there being generally a propensity
to sweat. “On the first day the sweating was commonly
profuse and general, on the second it was more
moderate; but on both those, there happened frequent
and short remissions of the sweatings, at which times
the febrile heat increased, and the patient became more
uneasy. On the third day the disposition to sweat
was so much abated that the skin was generally dry; only
the forehead and backs of the hands continued moist.”
A great despondency and prostration of strength took
place from the first attack. On the first day they generally
dozed much, but were afterwards very watchful.
On the second day the pains in the head, loins, &amp;c. of
which they had complained before the attack, and which
were sometimes very acute in the forehead, generally
went off. Many on the first day were a little delirious,
but afterwards not until the recess of the fever.</p>

<p>The blood had no inflammatory crust; in warm
weather it was florid like arterial blood, and continued in
one soft homogeneous like mass, without any separation of
the serum after it was cold. When there was any separation,
the crassamentum was of too loose a texture.</p>

<p>This disease was not attended with any remarkable
thirst; but, on the third day, as the fever began to lessen,
or rather, says the Doctor, as the fulness of the pulse,
heat and disposition to sweat, began to abate, a nausea,
vomiting, or frequent reachings to vomit, came on especially
after the exhibition of either medicines or food.
A very few had a vomiting, either bilious or phlegmatic,
on the first day. The whole febrile state was attended
with an obstinate costiveness.</p>

<p>These were the principal symptoms with which the
febrile state was attended, and which generally went off
on the third day, or in seventy-two hours from the first
attack, without any salutary crisis, and was soon succeeded
by the second <i>stadium</i>, as our author calls it; a
state, though without a fever, much more terrible than
the former. The symptoms now were,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<p>1. The pulse, though hard and small, became less frequent;
very little more so than in health. Soon after
it became much slower, and very soft; this softness remaining
while any pulse could be felt. In many it gradually
subsided, till it became scarce perceptible; neither
could it be supported by any of the ordinary means
used for that purpose. After this the yellow suffusion, the
vomiting, delirium, restlessness, &amp;c. increased to a great
degree. Sometimes the pulse would recover its strength,
but only for a short time.</p>

<p>2. The heat did not exceed the natural, and was still
farther diminished as the pulse sunk; the skin became
cold, and the face, breast and extremities acquired something
of a livid colour. There was no great thirst, though
the sick had a great inclination for strong liquors.</p>

<p>3. The vomiting or reaching to vomit increased, and
in some were so constant, that neither medicines nor aliment
of any kind could be retained. Some vomited
blood, others only what was last exhibited, mixed with
phlegm, while others had what is called the <i>black vomit</i>.
But this, though its general appearance is black, appears
not to be entirely so, but owes its colour to a great number
of black flakey substances. These are by our author
supposed to be the bile mixed with the mucus of the
stomach, or adhering to it. He founds his opinion
upon observations from dissection, where the mucus of
the stomach was always found abraded, and the bile in
its cystis black, and sometimes very viscid. This change
in the state of the bile he has always observed in such as
died of this disease, and likewise that the blood was very
fluid, and the vessels of the viscera much distended. In
one case he found the bile of the consistence of turpentine,
and carbuncles or gangrenous specks on the stomach.</p>

<p>The reaching to vomit continued a longer or shorter
time, according to the state of the pulse; an increase of
fulness of the pulse being attended with an abatement of
the reaching, and the contrary.</p>

<p>In this state the patients were extremely unquiet, even
their sleep being frequently attended with dejection of
spirits and debility. This last symptom was so excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
that if the patient was only raised up in bed, or sometimes
if the head was only raised from the pillow, while
a little drink was given, the pulse sunk immediately, and
became sometimes so small, that it could scarce be felt:
they became cold, the skin became clammy, the delirium
increased, their lips and skin, especially about the
neck, face and extremities, as well as the nails, acquired
a livid colour. The restlessness and tossing were so great,
that it was sometimes scarce possible to keep the sick in
bed, though, even in this state, they made no particular
complaint, and if asked how they did, the reply was,
<i>Very well</i>.</p>

<p>A yellowness in the eyes became now very observable,
and this was soon diffused all over the body; but in
some, this colour did not appear until a little before
death, when it spread surprisingly quick, especially
about the breast and neck. Along with this were a
number of small spots of a scarlet, purple or livid colour.
These appeared principally about the neck and breast.</p>

<p>Some were obstinately costive, others the contrary,
with large, liquid and black stools, but others were relieved
by moderate stools, even though black. In some
they resembled tar, in smoothness, tenacity, colour and
consistence.</p>

<p>In this disease there was such a putrid dissolution of
the blood that hæmorrhages took place from almost all
parts of the body. In women the menstrua flowed,
sometimes in great quantity, even at irregular periods.
Blood flowed also from the eyes, nose, mouth and ears,
and from those parts where blisters had been laid on.
“Nay, (says our author) in the year 1739 or 1745, there
were one or two instances of an hæmorrhage from the
skin, without any apparent puncture, or any loss of the
scarf-skin.” The urine was pale while the patient was
not yellow, but a deep saffron colour when the yellowness
had come on. Sometimes it was turbid, at others
bloody, and the quantity of blood was always in proportion
to the state of the pulse; diminishing as the pulse
became more full, and increasing as it became weaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>

<p>In the third stage, which always terminated in death,
the pulse was exceedingly small and unequal, though soft;
the extremities were cold, clammy and livid; the face and
lips in some flushed, in others they were of a livid colour;
the livid specks increased so fast, that in some the whole
breast and neck appeared livid; the heart palpitated
strongly; the heat about the præcordia was greatly increased,
respiration became difficult, with frequent sighing;
the patient became anxious and extremely restless,
the sweat flowed from the face, neck and breast, blood
from the mouth or nose or ears, and in some from all together;
the deglutition became difficult, hiccup and subsultus
tendinum came on, the patient picked the bed-clothes,
was comatous or constantly delirious. In this
terrible state some continued eight, ten or twelve hours
before they died, even after they had been so long speechless,
and without any perceptible pulsation of the arteries
and wrists; whereas in all other acute diseases, death
follows immediately after the pulse in the wrists ceases.
When the disease was very acute, violent convulsions
seized the unhappy patient, and quickly brought this
stadium to its fatal end. After death the livid blotches
increased fast, especially about the face, neck and breast,
and the putrefaction began very early, or rather increased
very quickly. In hot weather, and when the symptoms
at first were very violent, there was little difference to be
observed between the stadia, the whole tragedy being
completed in less than forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>On this disease in general Dr. Lining remarks, that
the infection was increased by warm, and lessened by
cold, weather. In hot days the violence of the symptoms
were augmented to such a degree as sometimes to
become fatal to those who, in moderate weather, seemed
to be in no danger; while, on the other hand, in cold
days, some who had been in great danger were apparently
saved from the jaws of death. The disease was also
more fatal to those who lay in small chambers without a
proper ventilation, to such as were of an athletic
and full habit, to strangers, natives of a cold climate,
and to such as were most afraid of it, as well as to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
who had previously overheated themselves by exercise in
the sun, or by excessive drinking of strong liquors. It
proved also most certainly fatal to valetudinarians, or to
such as had been previously weakened by any disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Lind observes that “a yellow colour of the skin
is observed not only in common agues, but likewise
in other fevers; sometimes denoting, as in contagious
fevers, their malignant nature, at other times, as in
some West Indian fevers, an universal dissolution of
the blood and humours; and frequently this symptom
accompanies gentle discharges of the bile, and a diseased
liver.” In speaking of the disease in the West
Indies, he mentions some fevers, which he derives from
stagnated air, “of such a malignant nature, that the
people after being there a few days are suddenly seized
with violent vomitings, head-achs, deliriums, &amp;c. and
in two or three days more the whole body putrefies,
and the dissolved mass of blood issues from every
pore.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On considering the yellow fever particularly
he is of opinion that the remarkable dissolution
of the blood, together with the tendency to putrefaction
in the whole body, the black vomit, and other
characteristic symptoms, are often accidental though
fatal appearances in fevers of the West Indies. They
proceed, according to him, in such as are newly arrived,
sometimes from a gross habit of body, excessive drinking
of spiritous liquors, and from being afterwards
overheated in the sun; but the intense heat and unhealthfulness
of the air does much more frequently
produce all those symptoms. This fever was once
supposed to have been first carried into the West Indies
by a ship from Siam: <i>an opinion truly chimerical</i>;
as similar diseases have made their appearance, not only
in the East Indies, but in some of the southern parts of
Europe, during a season when the air was intensely
hot and unwholesome. This happened in the months
of September and October 1764, when excessive heat
and want of rain for some months gave rise to violent
epidemic bilious diseases, resembling those of the West
Indies, in the city of Cadiz in Spain, of which an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
hundred persons often died in a day. At this time
the winds blew mostly from the south, and after sunset
there fell an unusual and very heavy dew. The
disease began with alternate heats and chills, nausea,
pains of the head, back, and loins, and at the pit of the
stomach, These symptoms were often followed, in
less than 24 hours, with violent reachings, and a
vomiting of green and yellow bile, the smell of which
was very offensive. Some threw up an humour as
black as ink, and died soon after, in violent convulsions
and in a cold sweat. The pulse was sometimes
sunk, sometimes quick, but often varying. After the
first day, the surface of the body was generally either
cold, or dry and parched. The head-ach and stupor
often ended in a furious delirium, which quickly
proved fatal. The dead bodies having been examined
by order of the court of Madrid, the stomach, mesentery
and intestines were found covered with gangrenous
spots. The orifice of the stomach appeared to
have been greatly affected, the spots upon it being
ulcerated. The liver and lungs were both of a putrid
colour and texture.</p>

<p>“The stomach contained a quantity of an atrabilious
liquor, which, when poured on the ground, produced
a sensible effervescence; but, when mixed with spirit of
vitriol, a violent ebullition ensued. The dead bodies
turned so quickly putrid, that at the end of six hours their
stench was intolerable, and in some of them worms
were already found lodged in the stomach. His Majesty’s
ship the Tweed being at that time in Cadiz bay,
several of her men were taken ill when on shore, but,
by being carried on board, all of them recovered.
Neither did the black vomit or any other deadly
symptom of that fever make its appearance in any of
the ships. The dread of this distemper forced many
people of fashion to retire into the country, where they
remained in perfect safety.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lind further remarks, that in the yellow fever it
is a bad sign if the skin is very dry and rough; “and the
longer it continues in this state, the greater is the danger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
as such patients seldom recover, though the pulse
may give hopes, and the other symptoms also be fluttering;
for many have a good pulse in this fever a little
before death.” He also quotes Dr. Bruce, an eminent
physician of Barbadoes, whose account of the disease is to
the same purpose. He says it may come on at any
season of the year, but that the symptoms are most
severe when there is great heat joined with moisture.
The blood, even in the beginning of the disease, is of
a florid red colour, and as it were rarefied; the crassamentum
scarcely cohering; the serum of a clay-coloured
yellow. It sometimes finishes its course in 24
hours.</p>

<p>The account given by Dr. Hillary corresponds also
very much with that already given. The subjects of the
disease are the same with those already mentioned. He
has seen it at all seasons of the year, but it is worst in a
hot season, especially if it was preceded by moist and
warm weather. “Blood, taken even at the beginning
of the disease, is often of an exceeding florid red colour,
much rarefied and thin, and without the least appearance
of fiziness; and the crassamentum, when it has
stood till it is cold, will scarce cohere, but fluctuates;
the serum is very yellow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the second or third
day the blood is much more dissolved, the serum
more yellow, and the crassamentum loose, scarcely
cohering, but undulates like sizy water when shaken,
and sometimes has dark, blackish spots on its surface,
showing a strong gangrenescent diathesis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the
latter stage of this fever the blood is so attenuated
and dissolved, that we frequently see it flowing not
only out of the nose and mouth, but from the eyes,
and even through the very pores of the skin; also
great quantities of black, half-baked, half-mortified
blood is frequently voided, both by vomiting and
stool, with great quantities of yellow and blackish putrid
bile, by the same ways; and the urine, which
was before of a high icteritious colour, is now almost
black, and is frequently mixed with a quantity of half-dissolved
blood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Soon after death the body appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
much fuller of livid, large, blackish, mortified
spots, particularly about the præcordia and hypocondres,
especially the right; which parts seem to be,
even from the first seizure, the principal seat of this
terrible disease. And upon opening the bodies of
those who die of it, we generally find the gall-bladder
and biliary ducts filled with a putrid blackish bile,
and the liver and stomach, and adjoining parts, full of
blackish and mortified spots, and sometimes gangrenes,
in those, as also in several other parts of the
body. And the whole corpse soon putrefies after
death, and can be kept but a few hours above
ground.”</p>

<p>Dr. Jackson, in describing the yellow fever of Jamaica,
acknowledges the difficulty of characterising the disease,
even though he is of opinion that it “possesses some
characteristics of its own, different from those of any
other.” In a note at the end of his work, he observes
the impropriety of calling it the <i>yellow</i> fever;
because that yellowness sometimes does not appear at all;
and in no one case does it ordinarily show itself till the
latter stages. “I know also (says he) that most of the
practitioners of Jamaica consider it only as an aggravated
species of the remittent, the common endemic
of hot climates. It appeared to me, I must confess, in
a different light.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It may not, however, be improper
here to take notice of the opinion of Dr. Moseley,
who has endeavoured to persuade us that it is no
other than the <i>kausos</i>, or ardent fever, of the ancients.
But the yellow fever of the West Indies is, by Dr.
Moseley’s own confession, in some measure peculiar
to strangers newly arrived in tropical climates. The
<i>kausos</i>, we are informed, made its appearance in the
islands of the Archipelago, and on the coasts of the
contiguous continents, indiscriminately among men
and women, natives and foreigners: in fact it has not,
as far as I can perceive, any claim to be considered as a
distinct disease. If I rightly understand Hippocrates,
or the description of the still more accurate Aretæus,
<i>kausos</i> in reality is only an accidental condition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
common endemic of the country, where the force of
the fever is chiefly exerted upon the stomach and alimentary
canal. In this manner it appears frequently
in Jamaica, and in the southern provinces of America.
In the hot months of summer, it appears occasionally
in every climate; and is not necessarily accompanied
with, nor does it depend upon, a general inflammatory
diathesis of the system for its existence.”</p>

<p>The Doctor divides this disease into three species:
1. Where “signs of putrefaction are evident at a very
early stage, which is generally rapid in its course, and
which casually terminates in black vomiting. Yellowness
seldom or never fails to make its appearance in
the present instance; and perhaps it is the only one
which, strictly speaking, can be called the yellow fever.
2. A form of fever which has either no remissions, or
remissions which are scarcely perceptible; in which
signs of nervous affection are more obvious than symptoms
of putrescency; and in which yellowness and black
vomiting are rare occurrences. 3. Another form, in
which regular paroxysms and remissions cannot be traced,
but in which there are marks of violent irritation,
and appearances of inflammatory diathesis in the earlier
stage, which give way, after a short continuance,
to signs of debility and putrescency, to which yellowness
frequently succeeds, or even sometimes the so
much dreaded vomiting of matter of a dark colour.
The disease in these three forms appears to be in reality
one and the same. The difference of the symptoms
probably arises from very trivial or very accidental
causes. It is in some measure peculiar to strangers
from colder regions soon after their arrival in the West
Indies, and may generally be distinguished from the common
endemic of the country, not only by a total want of
paroxysms and remissions, but likewise by a certain expression
of the eye and countenance, with something unusually
disagreeable in the feelings, of which words
convey only an imperfect idea.”</p>

<p>The symptoms enumerated by Dr. Jackson are in
general the same with those already taken notice of.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
He mentions likewise a degree of confusion frequently
joined with <i>grimness</i>, difficult to be described in words,
but which a person acquainted with the appearances of
the disease immediately recognises as one of its distinguishing
marks. In the second stage he says, that no
sweat or moisture was now observable on any part of the
body: the state of the skin impressed the idea as if it
were not pervious to any degree of perspiration, and heat
gradually forsook the surface and extremities: the tongue
became moist, and at the same time frequently clean about
the edges: the gums became redder, more spongy, and
showed a greater disposition to bleed: vomiting was
troublesome: the matter thrown up was ropy, in large
quantity, and abounding with villous or mucous flakes
of a darker colour. The circulation in the extreme
vessels became gradually more languid; the natural heat
retired from the surface of the body, which was now dry
and impervious; the pulse returned nearly to its ordinary
state, or became slow, full and regular; the yellowness
increased fast, so that the whole body was frequently
yellow as an orange, or of as deep a colour as the skin of
an American savage: anxiety was inexpressible; vomiting
was irrestrainable, and the vomiting of a matter like
the grounds of coffee at last made its appearance. This
matter was often as black as soot, where the progress of
the disease had been rapid; while it was not only less
intensely black, but often tinged with green, where the
disease had been more slow and gradual. The number
of villous or mucous flakes, in the matter discharged by
vomit, increased as the disease advanced, and with them
were joined streaks of blood, which seemed principally to
come from the throat and gums. As the disease advanced,
the vomiting became more frequent, but was seldom accompanied
with any violent retching. Quantities of
liquor were discharged, so enormous that it was often
difficult to imagine whence they came; after which the
patient enjoyed some respite, till a similar collection was
made. As soon as the matter discharged by vomit acquired
this dark and sooty colour, the belly generally
became loose, the stools being black, smooth, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
unlike tar or molasses; the tongue became clean, the
gums putrid; hæmorrhages, or rather <i>oozings of blood</i>,
were sometimes observed in different parts of the body,
while livid blotches made their appearance on the belly
and insides of the thighs. The pulse, which during the
latter stages of the distemper could scarcely be distinguished
from that of a person in health, became at last
irregular, quick, or intermitting; soon after which coma
or convulsions closed the scene. Sometimes the yellowness
succeeded the black vomiting. In these the vomiting
began unexpectedly, or without much previous
affection of the stomach: the colour was commonly intensely
black; the patient turned yellow almost in an
instant, and died in a very short time. When any one
recovered from this deplorable situation, of which there
were some few instances, the termination was not by
any regular crisis. The black vomiting ceased, sometimes
apparently in consequence of treatment, sometimes
evidently of its own accord: but a vomiting of
a ropy, glutinous matter continued for a great length of
time, together with an extreme irritability of the stomach,
and a very peculiar state of the skin; which sometimes
did not recover its natural smoothness and unctuosity
for several weeks.</p>

<p>The disposition to faint, so common in the yellow
fever, is supposed by Dr. Jackson to arise from a kind of
torpor in the nervous system, rather than the usual causes
of fainting. For this opinion he assigns as a reason, that
“the patient was often able to stand upright for some
time, and even to walk to a considerable distance;
and, when at last overcome, was observed to fall down
in a torpid, rather than a fainting, state.”</p>

<p>In dissections our author observed that the omentum
and all its appendages were in a dry and parched state,
and of an uncommon dark grey colour. But, along
with this dark grey colour, and want of unctuosity and
moisture, usually met with in the abdomen, the stomach
and intestines had a dirty yellow appearance, were highly
putrefied, and much distended with wind. The liver
and spleen were generally enlarged in size; the former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
of a deeper yellow than any of the other abdominal
viscera; while the texture of the spleen was often less
firm than natural. The bile was usually black and
thick, like tar or molasses; the blood-vessels of the liver
bearing marks of uncommon distension. A quantity of
black fluid, similar to that ejected by vomit, was found
in the stomach, which fluid our author says positively
derived its blackness from the bile, the flakes observed
to float in it being parts of the villous coat of the stomach
abraded. He denies that the black colour of the
matter vomited is owing to blood, as many authors have
supposed. He says that the passage of the bile might
be easily traced from the gall-duct into the pylorus.</p>

<p>This being in the Doctor’s opinion the only true kind
of yellow fever, we shall not follow him through the
description of the other two species, but proceed to consider
that remarkable and excessively fatal distemper
which appeared in the year 1793, first in the West India
islands, and then on the American continent. Dr.
Chisholm, who has described the distemper very particularly,
derives it from the coast of Africa, and gives the
following account of its origin on the authority of a
Mr. J. Paiba, “one of the adventurers in the Boullam
scheme; and who, despairing of success, left the coast
of Africa in a vessel called the <i>Hankey</i>. This vessel
sailed from England in April 1792 with stores and
adventurers for the intended colony at Boullam. The
people were all in good health: that part of the coast
of Africa on which they touched is remarkable for its
healthiness; only it is destitute of water except what
can be procured by digging temporary wells on the
beach, and which is brackish, and consequently unwholesome.
The ferocity of the negroes who inhabit
that part of the continent prevented them from being
accommodated on shore, so that they found themselves
obliged to remain on board the Hankey for nine
months. As the rainy season came on almost immediately
after their arrival on the African coast, they
attempted to shelter themselves by raising the sides of
the vessel several feet, and covering it with a wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
roof.” Thus were upwards of two hundred persons,
among whom were many women and children, confined
in such a manner as must be supposed capable of
producing fevers of a bad kind, if they could be produced
by such causes. Accordingly a malignant fever did
break out; the vessel was not ventilated, nor were the
bed-clothes, &amp;c. of the sick destroyed; from whence
Dr. Chisholm concludes that the infection remained
on board the vessel. The Doctor then proceeds to give
the following account of the vessel after her departure
from Boullam<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> “Capt. Coxe, finding the water at
Boullam unwholesome, proceeded with his ship to
Bissao, where there is a Portuguese settlement, for a
supply. The ship was navigated by about twelve seamen,
most of whom had not experienced sickness, and
had probably been procured from Sierra Leone: at
any rate they were then taken on board for the first
time. Of these, before the return of the Hankey to
Boullam, nine died; and the remainder, with the
captain, were reduced to a deplorable state. The
time for which the Hankey was chartered being expired,
Mr. Paiba, with his family, intended to return
to England in her; but as no seamen could be procured
they put to sea, having on board the captain, sick,
and only the mate, Mr. Paiba and two seamen to navigate
the ship. With much difficulty they arrived at
St. Jago, where they fortunately found the Charon
and Scorpion ships of war. Capt. Dodd of the former,
humanely rendered them every service in his
power, and on leaving them put two men of each ship
on board the Hankey. With this aid they proceeded
to the West Indies; a voyage to England being
impracticable in their wretched state. On the third
day after leaving St. Jago, the men they procured
from the ships of war were seized with the fever, which
had carried off three fourths of those on board the
Hankey at Boullam; and, having no assistance, two
of the four died: the remaining two were put on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
board here in the most wretched state possible. Capt.
Dodd, on his arrival at Barbadoes from the coast of Africa,
was ordered to convoy the homeward-bound fleet of
merchantmen. In the execution of his orders he came to
Grenada on the 27th of May, and, hearing of the
mischief which the Hankey had been the cause of,
mentioned that several of the Charon’s and Scorpion’s
people were sent on board the Hankey at St. Jago, to
repair her rigging, &amp;c. that from this circumstance,
and the communication which his barge’s crew had
with that ship, the pestilence was brought on board
both ships; and that of the Charon’s crew thirty
died, and of the Scorpion’s, about fifteen. The Hankey
arrived at the port of St. George’s (in Grenada) on
the 19th of February, in the most distressed situation,
and for a few days lay in the bay, but was afterwards
brought into the careenage. From this period are we
to date the commencement of a disease before, I believe,
unknown in this country, and certainly unequalled
in its destructive nature.”</p>

<p>This account of the introduction of the fever (which
however is by Dr. Chisholm accounted very different
from the yellow fever above described) is so clear and
distinct, that, at first reading, it commands our belief.
It hath not, however, met with universal approbation;
and even the <i>facts</i>, for which both parties appeal to Mr.
Paiba and capt. Dodd, vary from one another in a surprising
manner. Dr. Trotter, in his Medicina Nautica,
p. 328, gives the following account: “Dr. Chisholm
tells us, that the ships of war on the African station,
having sent men to assist the Hankey, after numbers
had perished from the fever, received the infection by
means of this communication, and that in the Charon
thirty died, and fifteen in the Scorpion. Capt. Dodd,
who at that time had his broad pendant in the Charon,
now commands the Atlas of 98 guns in the fleet;
Mr. Smithers, the surgeon, is at present in the Formidable,
a second rate, also in the fleet; <i>from them</i> I
have copied the following narrative of their transactions
with the Hankey:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

<p>“When the squadron under commodore Dodd
came to St. Jago in 1793, the Hankey lay there in
great distress for want of hands; having buried above
one hundred persons, men, women and children, from
the time she had been at Bulam. <i>The fever was now
overcome</i>: Mr. Smithers saw two men that had lately
recovered. He left a quantity of bark. The Charon
and Scorpion sent two men each to assist in navigating
her to the West Indies. The Hankey at this port
was cleaned, washed with vinegar, and fumigated. <i>No
fever appeared in either of the men of war</i>, in consequence
of this communication; they arrived at Grenada
in perfect health, but did not go into the same
part of the island to which the Hankey went. The
Charon, at this harbour received some seamen from
the merchant ships then taking in cargoes for England;
she had afterwards <i>fourteen</i> cases of yellow fever, of
which one died; but it is remarkable that the Scorpion
did not bury a single man during the whole voyage<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span>
It is probable from these facts, that the Hankey
<i>did not</i> import the infection that produced the
Grenada fever; for, <i>after the disease was worn out</i>, she
had a passage to make to the West indies of many
hundred leagues. It is also doubtful how the effects
left in the Hankey could produce the fever, for the
<i>bedding was thrown away</i>, and what clothing remained
had been aired, and probably had scarcely been in
contact with the body after being sick.”</p>

<p>The discordance between this and the foregoing account
is abundantly evident. Dr. Chisholm’s account
of the bedding, &amp;c. is also very different. “Our lieutenant
governor, Ninian Home, esq. some time after
the disease became epidemic, informed me, that, in
consequence of the information he had received of
the clothes, &amp;c. of the victims of the fever at Boullam
being still on board the Hankey, he ordered Capt.
Coxe to be brought before him and some gentlemen
of the council. He then acknowledged, that <i>all the
effects</i> of those who had died were then on board his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
ship, and said that he <i>would not</i> destroy them, unless
he was indemnified for the loss he might sustain,
should the heirs of the deceased call on him for those
effects. Every argument was used to induce him to
destroy the articles, but the only one which influences
a man of this description, <i>indemnification</i>; and he of
course carried the seminium of the disease to England.”
It was this consideration which induced the governor to
write to the secretary of state, and in consequence of his
representation the vessel was obliged to perform quarantine
in England, a circumstance which Dr. Trotter
mentions without approbation.</p>

<p>Thus far the matter of <i>fact</i> seems to be very much
obscured; and the more we investigate, the more we are
involved in darkness. In the Medical Repository, vol.&nbsp;i,
p. 484, we find the following severe censure passed upon
Dr. Chisholm by the late Dr. Smith of New York:
“It belongs to another part of this paper to assign the
probable motives of Dr. Chisholm for maintaining
that the fever was imported into Grenada: certain it
is that he avowed a different opinion to Mr. Paiba, to
whom he freely declared, that he could by no means
trace the disease to the <i>Hankey</i>; and that he believed
it to be of local origin, owing to the unhealthy condition
of the careenage, and the particular prevailing
winds: and, to confirm this notion, he informed
Mr. Paiba that a similar disease, from the same cause,
though in a less degree, had existed in St. George’s
some years before.”</p>

<p>This was plainly giving Dr. Chisholm <i>the lie</i>; which,
whatever might have been the consequence between the
two parties, absolutely supersedes, to any impartial and
unconcerned person, the evidence of <i>both</i>, at least as far
as regards the origin of this disease. It is not, however,
to be supposed that Dr. Chisholm would pass such a censure
unnoticed. He did accordingly reply in a letter to
Dr. Smith, who had sent him a copy of the Repository,
with a letter inviting him to defend what he had said.
Dr. Smith died before this letter reached him, but the
principal part has appeared in the Medical Repository,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
vol.&nbsp;ii, p.&nbsp;285. In this Dr. Chisholm retracts what he
had said concerning the mortality on board the Charon
and Scorpion ships of war. “I have lately received
(says he) from a gentleman of the navy here, a log-book
of the Charon, kept by one of her officers during
the voyage in question. In this I find, that no sickness
took place in either of these ships in consequence
of this interview. A log-book is unquestionable
evidence, and I therefore admit it.” As to the more
serious part of the charge, viz. that Dr. Chisholm had
wilfully misrepresented matters, the Doctor replies, that
the narrative published by him was in general such as he
had from Mr. Paiba; not indeed in manuscript, as Dr.
Smith stated his to have been, but in conversation; and
that this conversation took place expressly with a view
to elucidate the cause of the fever, which he (Dr. Chisholm)
could not account for by any reasoning from
local causes, but heard it very generally ascribed to infection
from the Hankey. Mr. Paiba was introduced
to Dr. Chisholm at the request of the latter by the Hon.
Samuel Mitchill <i>now</i> (the letter is dated Sept. 6th 1768
probably 1798) the senior member of the council of
Grenada. “Mr. Mitchill (says the Doctor) brought
Mr. Paiba to my house, and was present during the
greatest part of the time the conversation continued.
I found Mr. Paiba very willing to give me every information
in his power relative to the state of the Bulama
or Boulam colony, and of the ship Hankey;
but I found him strongly disinclined to fall in with the
universally received opinion, that that ship introduced
the disease. The particulars I have given, are those
Mr. Paiba related to me in this conversation; and, in
order to be correct, I immediately, after Mr. Paiba
left me, committed them to paper. Mr. Paiba promised
to favour me with a written account; and in
order to direct that gentleman’s attention to the points
I considered as of most importance, I drew up a set of
queries, and Mr. Mitchill charged himself with the
delivery of it. A copy of these I have now in my
possession, and a slight attention will exhibit my view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
in framing them, and show the doubts respecting the
nature of the epidemic which suggested them. Although
I repeatedly, through Mr. Mitchill and Mr.
Palmer, the gentlemen with whom Mr. Paiba resided
in the country, renewed my request to have this promise
fulfilled, Mr. Paiba left the Island without gratifying
it. If no other strong proof existed of something
peculiar in the fever which at that time prevailed,
the circumstance of my formally applying to Mr.
Paiba for information relative to the state of the
Hankey, and of taking the trouble to obtain an interview
with him, presents an evidence as conclusive as
can well be required by reasonable men. But the belief
of the infection of the Hankey was <i>universal</i>, nor
was it by any means confined to those whose interest
might have been affected by the prosperity of an infant
colony on the coast of Africa.”</p>

<p>Another charge against Dr. Chisholm is, that he falsifies
the date of the Hankey’s arrival at Grenada; and
which in Dr. Smith’s paper is brought forward in the following
words: “In p.&nbsp;91 the Doctor remarks, that, ‘in
the short space of time from the beginning of March
to the end of May, 200 of about 500 sailors, who
manned the ships in the regular trade, died of this
fever.’ By this it appears that the fever in question
broke out as early as the beginning of March. The
disingenuousness of this author is particularly evident
from this quotation, if the period of the commencement
of the disease be correctly assigned: and that it
is so is probable from the difficulty of concealing the
fact; as there must have been thousands of witnesses
to the progress of the fever. When therefore it was
thought proper to fix the odium of introducing the
disease upon the Hankey (a project of which Dr.
Chisholm seems originally to have had no idea) it became
necessary for him to fix an earlier date to her
arrival. Now, that the Hankey did not arrive till
towards the latter end of March, is verified by the
concurring testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Paiba, and of
Mr. Bell, of this city (New York) who happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
be in Grenada about that time, and was personally
acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Paiba in that
island.”</p>

<p>In answer to this Dr. Chisholm repeats his declaration
that the Hankey arrived at Grenada on the 18th
of <i>February</i>, and not on the 19th of March, as Dr.
Smith (supposed on the authority of Mr. Paiba) had
stated. In proof of this he produces an incontestible
evidence, viz. an extract from the St. George’s Gazette
in Grenada, of date 19th of February, which begins
thus: “By the ship Hankey of London, arrived here
<i>yesterday</i> from the island of Boulam on the coast of Africa,
we are informed,” &amp;c. The remainder of the extract
contains an account of the excessive mortality on
board the ships; which, as it may perhaps be exaggerated,
it is needless to transcribe.</p>

<p>The next thing of consequence is the destruction of
the bed-clothes and effects of the deceased; of which
Dr. Smith says, “Before the Hankey put to sea, all
the bedding of the sick was thrown overboard or destroyed;
the ship was washed from stem to stern, both
above and below, with salt water; and the purification
was completed by fumigating her with tar, pitch
and gun-powder. In this clean condition they bade
farewel to Bulama on the 22d of November, 1792;
but, in attempting to pass through the channel near
to the entrance into the open sea, in a dark and foggy
night, they got aground on a sand-bank, upon the
north side of the island of Formosa or Warang, belonging
to the Bijugas, who are represented as cannibals.
The extreme terror excited by this accident
was not calculated to improve the health of the people
on board the Hankey; so that, when it became
necessary to take measures for their security and deliverance,
only four men were found in a condition to
do duty, and all of these had intermittents. With
them, however, and his lady, Mr. Paiba set off, in an
open boat, for Bissao, to obtain assistance from the
Portuguese settlement. Thither he arrived, rowing
through rains and fogs, in a leaky boat, after being out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
two nights and a day; and having obtained such help
as he could, returned to the Hankey, got her off, and
carried her to Bissao. On the passage there <i>eight</i> persons
died who belonged to this ship. At Bissao they
refitted, and the Hankey <i>was a second time purified as
completely as she had been before leaving Bulama</i>.”</p>

<p>In answer to all this Dr. Chisholm <i>again declares</i>, “that
the bedding and effects of the deceased <i>were preserved</i>
on board the Hankey, and constituted the seminium
of the infection. Capt. William Liddle, of the ship
General Mathew, saw them on board; and it was in
consequence of that gentleman’s representation that
the lieutenant governor, Mr. Home, entered into a
strict investigation of the matter; the general result of
which I have given; and the authenticity of it may be
depended on. Capt. Liddle is now resident in London,
and Mr. Byles, the governor’s secretary, is now
resident commissary at Grenada; and these gentlemen
will readily testify to the truth of my statement. The
destructive articles I have mentioned <i>were not thrown
overboard</i> till the Hankey arrived in Grenville Bay,
when they were destroyed at the request of Mr. Prendfoot,
the gentleman who chartered the ship for England.”</p>

<p>Dr. Chisholm is likewise charged with having mis-stated
the case of a Capt. Remington, said to be the first
who suffered by the fever in Grenada. The words in
Dr. Chisholm’s Essay are, “A Capt. Remington, an intimate
acquaintance of Capt. Coxe’s, was the first person
who visited the Hankey after her arrival in St.
George’s bay. This person went on board of her in the
evening after she anchored, and remained three days;
at the end of which time he left St. George’s, and proceeded
in a drogher (a coasting vessel) to Grenville
bay, where his ship, the Adventure lay. He was seized
with the malignant pestilential fever on the passage;
and the violence of the symptoms increased so rapidly,
as, on the third day, to put an end to his existence.”
In opposition to this Dr. Smith gives the following statement
from Mr. Paiba: “He (Capt. Remington) had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
been all day and all night coming from Grenville bay,
and had been wet through. He slept on board in his
clothes; and went in an open boat <i>the next day</i> back
to his ship: enough to kill any one in that climate.”
Dr. Chisholm replies “that the above statement is not
correct, nor founded on fact; Dr. Chisholm’s evidence
for what he said was founded on the information of
captains of vessels, who knew all the circumstances of
his visit to the Hankey; and of Dr. Stewart, an eminent
practitioner, who attended him at Grenville bay,
when he landed there. Lastly, that the idea of his
having returned to Grenville bay in an open boat, is
absurd; nothing of the kind having been ever attempted.”</p>

<p>From this tedious account it is plain that the evidence
relative to the importation of the fever into Grenada
by the Hankey is quite contradictory, and subversive
of itself, because we are unable to judge between
the two disputants. A further consideration of it would
lead us entirely from the subject of this treatise, into an
endless dispute about which of the two parties had spoken
the truth. Setting aside therefore <i>the whole</i> of the
evidence on both sides as insufficient, we shall now proceed
to give an account of the symptoms of the distemper
as described by Dr. Chisholm, and to which description
there has never been any objection made.</p>

<p>In the most violent kind of this fever, according to
our author, “the patient, without any previous complaint,
suddenly becomes giddy; he loses his eye-sight;
every thing seems to move round him with inconceivable
velocity; he falls down almost insensible, and in
that state remains near half an hour, or upwards.
During this paroxysm the body feels cold, and is over-spread
with cold sweat, which issues from every pore
in astonishing abundance. On his recovery the cold
goes off, and is instantly succeeded by intense heat, and
quick, small, hard pulse; the head achs dreadfully,
particularly the fore part; generally accompanied with
pain in the right side and at the præcordia. The last,
however, has never been acute, and may rather be called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
oppression than pain. The eyes are much inflamed,
watery, protruded, and wildly rolling; the face much
flushed; much heat is felt at the pit of the stomach,
and that organ seems to be considerably affected by
the frequent retching and vomiting which then come
on. The patient soon after complains of intolerable
pains in the small of his back and in the calves of his
legs; but the latter appears to be most violent. During
twelve, eighteen, twenty-four or thirty-six hours,
these symptoms continue increasing, except the quickness
and hardness of the pulse, which does not change
materially during that time; and are then succeeded
by general coldness, cold sweat, a greater or less degree
of coma and delirium, or a state very much resembling
intoxication. Life in this state is lengthened out to
sixty or ninety hours from the first attack. A short interval
of reason then takes place; the patient considers
himself better, and is, for a moment, flattered with the
prospect of recovery: but a fit as sudden and unexpected
as the first comes on, during which he foams
at the mouth, rolls his eyes dreadfully, and throws
out and pulls back his extremities in quick succession.
In general the patient expires in this fit; but some
have recovered from it, and continued rational for a
few hours longer, when a second fit has carried them
off.”</p>

<p>This, without much deviation, was the general progress
of the worst kind of the fever. In some, however,
a comatose disposition showed itself from the very first;
in others the disease began with short convulsive fits in
frequent succession, followed by constant delirium and
cold clammy sweat, without any intervening heat. In
a few cases the first symptoms were coldness and shivering,
as in other fevers.</p>

<p>The distinguishing symptoms were the uncommonly
sudden attack, the remarkably acute pain in the loins and
calves of the legs, the watery, inflamed and rolling eye,
flushing of the face, tendency to coma, the pain generally
confined to the forehead, and the peculiar cast of the
delirium, during which the looks and actions of the patient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
very much resembled those of a person intoxicated.
It was never furious in any other way than by making
efforts to get out of bed; and these in a few instances
rose so high that the patients got up, dressed themselves,
and walked out a considerable way before they could be
overpowered. “The strength during the delirium is
to appearance surprisingly great, for it is frequently
necessary to use the united efforts of two or three men
to keep the patient in bed. This is, however, no more
than a spasmodic affection of the muscles; for in reality
the powers of the sick in this disease are reduced
to the extreme of debility, as is seen in the convalescent
state.”</p>

<p>The most unequivocal characteristic of this disease,
however, according to our author, is the appearance of
a kind of petechiæ, but which look rather like red or livid
patches than what is commonly understood by that
word. They were <i>always</i> the forerunners of death.
In a few very violent cases the body was almost of a livid
or black colour, but they were generally seated on the
neck, shoulders and breast. <i>Vibices</i> also, like those in
the plague, described p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_258">258</a>, sometimes made their appearance,
and were also a fatal presage.</p>

<p>Hæmorrhage occurred much more frequent and profuse
in this than in any other acute distemper our author
had met with. “In several instances, the immensity of
blood discharged has evidently been the more immediate
cause of death. The robust, plethoric and gross
habits have been the most subject to it. It has taken
place from the nostrils, mouth, anus, and urethra;
sometimes from the canthi (corners) of the eyes; but
never, I believe, from the ears or pores of the skin.
The most profuse discharge has been from the nostrils
and anus, and has frequently, amounted to three or
four pounds at a time; the stools having been on those
occasions entirely composed of pure blood. Towards
the close of life, the blood thus discharged has appeared
granulous, or like ichor, with a sediment of a black
gritty substance, and has been so extremely offensive
as to oblige all the attendants to keep at a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
distance till the hæmorrhage ceased. Hæmorrhage,
however, has never been critical, nor has it in any
instance permanently relieved the head-ach or pain in
the breast or side.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nearly about the period that
these profuse discharges came on, a rawness was felt on
the whole of the interior surface of the nose, and on
several parts of it little ulcers formed; on others,
small eschars, which were remarkably itchy, but on
being touched, or an attempt made to detach them
from the membrane of the nose, were very painful, and
bled. These disappeared in proportion to the patient’s
recovery; and I have reason to suspect, that, when
the issue of the disease was fatal, these little eschars
became gangrenous.”</p>

<p>In this distemper there was always a tendency to coma
after the first two days; and after the third, it certainly
came on. On examining the heads of two who died
convulsed after having been comatose for some time, a
great quantity of serum was found in the brain; and, on
narrowly inspecting the eyes of those who were afterwards
seized with coma, the pupil was found manifestly
dilated.</p>

<p>A remarkable symptom unnoticed in any other fever
is taken notice of by our author; viz. an affection of the
testicles. “About the end of the second day the patient
began to complain of a violent pain in these parts,
accompanied with a contraction of the spermatic cord,
and a drawing up of the testicles towards the abdominal
ring. On examination they appear very much
lessened in size, are drawn up considerably towards the
abdomen, and the scrotum appears at the same time
remarkably flaccid and empty. The surface of the
scrotum becomes soon after very painful, and an excoriation
takes place, chiefly at the most descending
part, from which a considerable quantity of very offensive
purulent matter issues: at the same time a similar
discharge from the urethra takes place, which ceases
with the disease when the event is favourable, or becomes
ichorous and bloody, and insufferably fœtid
when death is the consequence. In cases which terminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
favourably, the whole of the scrotum, in a few
days, is covered with a crust of hardened pus, which
in the convalescent state, comes away very easily by
means of a warm bath. The thickness of this coat
may be about the fourth of a line; and, when separated,
it much resembles moistened parchment. In
fatal cases, this affection of the scrotum always terminates
in gangrene a few hours before death.”</p>

<p>Another remarkable symptom is the change of voice
to a shrill, soft and low sound when compared with the
natural tone, at the same time that the syllables are more
distinguished, and the words are strangely lengthened out
in a drawling and whining manner. This change of
voice affords a pretty certain prognostic; every alteration
towards the natural tone being an almost certain
sign of a favourable change, and the contrary if the
voice becomes farther removed from it.</p>

<p>The pains felt in this fever were in a great measure
peculiar to it, and seem to have been of a spasmodic nature.
In the head the pain shot from the forehead, to
which it was confined, invariably towards the bottom
of the orbits, where it was generally exquisite. Sometimes
it extended to the temples, where there was always
a throbbing; but in no case did it extend to the
back part, or over the whole head. This pain extended
also to the balls of the eyes, which were protruded, and
seemed ready to start from their orbits, with an inflammation
externally, and a sensation of pain internally,
rendering the admission of light intolerable. In the
legs the pain had its seat at the top of the great tendon,
immediately below the calf, and in the point where it
was seated a gnawing sensation was felt, occasioning exquisite
torture, with an involuntary contraction of the
limb; so that, on the whole, our author concludes that
this pain much resembles the cramp, differing only in
being more permanent.</p>

<p>With regard to the pulse, our author observes, that
in this disease “it never intermits. Even at the approach
of death it has not intermitted, but has generally
been remarkably tremulous, and so slow as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
beat no more than thirty times in a minute. On the
whole, it has not been found quicker than 130, or
slower than 30, in a minute.” In violent cases the
pulse was hard, quick and small, but sometimes full;
and when it was so it was a good sign. It was however
subject to excessive variations; and it frequently happened,
“especially in the robust, that, after the first
stage, flushing and chillness have often alternated in
less than a minute; and that, although the skin felt
considerably warm, the pulse has been no more than
52; but that, even when the low state came on, in
which there was always a disagreeable coldness of the
surface, it has been as quick, and nearly as full, as
during the preceding febrile stage, although unaccompanied
with thirst, or any other evident symptom of
the existence of fever.”</p>

<p>In the state of delirium, Dr. Chisholm observes, that,
whatever was the subject of the patient’s raving thoughts,
he was always strongly under the impression of fear;
and a word from the physician always reduced him to
implicit obedience, however restless he might have been
before. During this state he complained of no pain,
even from blisters, nor was he sensible of the operation
of laxative medicines. On being asked about his situation,
he always answered that he was very well, and
sensible of no pain, as in the yellow fever already described.
It is observable, however, that the yellow colour,
so remarkable in the former, seldom took place in
the Boulam fever; but indeed this symptom, as has formerly
been noticed, is by no means a characteristic either
of the one disease or the other; but Dr. Chisholm
observes “that in some protracted cases on shore, and in
some among the sailors, which might have been a
combination of the pestilential and yellow fevers, this
symptom appeared about the 5th, 7th or 9th day.”</p>

<p>Besides the petechiæ and vibices, already mentioned,
Dr. Chisholm takes notice of two other sorts of eruptions,
which appeared about the lips: the one was such
as frequently appears at the termination of the common
remittents, and was favourable; the other resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
spots made by the fine black pencil of a painter, all
round the mouth, but especially the upper lip, and certainly
affording a fatal prognostic.</p>

<p>This disease was attended with a suppression of urine,
a violent pain above the os pubis, a scalding in the urethra,
a sense of fulness, without any visible swelling, a
contraction and distortion of the penis; the urine generally
of a deep red, sometimes brownish, green, very
often bloody, and in a few cases much inclining to black,
and of an oily consistence. Its smell was generally very
offensive. All the excretions were exceedingly offensive,
but the fæces most remarkably so towards the latter end
of the disease; for in the beginning they had no remarkable
fœtor. The sick were almost universally
costive, which our author supposes to have arisen from a
suspension of tone in the intestinal canal; for by exciting
action in the fibres a large evacuation generally ensued.
The colour of the fæces varied from yellow, or
a yellowish white, to black; and from a considerable
degree of thickness, to the exact appearance of coffee-grounds.
The matter discharged by vomit also varied
from porraceous to black, and resembling coffee badly
boiled.</p>

<p>In this disease, as in the plague described by Thucydides,
most other diseases degenerated into it, or partook
of its nature. Dysenteries suddenly stopped, and were
immediately succeeded by the symptoms of pestilential
fever. A remarkable instance of this is given in twenty-seven
recruits, who had been seized with dysentery, in
consequence of being exposed to rain, receiving the infection
in the hospital to which they were carried. The
medicines exhibited with a view to cure the dysentery
seemed to be attended with surprising effect; but in a
short time symptoms of pestilential fever came on, even
in a few hours after those of dysentery had disappeared.
In like manner catarrhal complaints soon changed their
nature. Convalescents from other diseases, such as laboured
under chronical complaints, particularly rheumatism
and inflammation of the liver, were particularly
subject to it. “The puerperal fever became malignant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
and of course fatal; and even among pregnant negro
women, who might otherwise have had it in the usual
mild degree peculiar to that description of people, many
were reduced to a very dangerous situation by it. In
short, every disease in which the patient was liable to
infection, sooner or later assumed the appearance, and
acquired the danger, of the pestilential fever.”</p>

<p>This fever was said to be propagated from Grenada
to others of the West India islands, and to the United
States, where in the same year, 1793, it raged with great
violence in Philadelphia. Without entering into any
inquiry at present concerning the truth of this report, or
the origin of the fever itself, let us see whether from the
symptoms enumerated by Dr. Rush, who hath written a
very lengthy dissertation upon the disease, it was the
same with the Boulam fever already described. According
to him the fever in 1793 was frequently preceded by
“costiveness, a dull pain in the right side, defect of appetite,
flatulence, perverted taste, heat in the stomach,
giddiness or pain in the head, a dull, watery, brilliant,
yellow or red eye, dim and imperfect vision, hoarseness,
or slight sore throat, low spirits, or unusual vivacity,
a moisture on the hands, a disposition to sweat at
nights, or after moderate exercise, or a sudden suppression
of night sweats.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On entering a sick
room the physician was first struck by the <i>countenance</i>
of the patient. It was as much unlike that
which is exhibited in the common bilious fever, as the
face of a wild animal is unlike that of a domestic one.
The eyes were sad, watery, and so inflamed in some
cases as to resemble two balls of fire. Sometimes they
had a most brilliant or ferocious appearance. The
face was suffused with blood, or of a dusky colour, and
the whole countenance was dusky and clouded. After
the 10th of September, when the determination of
blood to the brain became universal, there was a preternatural
dilation of the pupil. Sighing attended in
almost every case. The skin was dry, and frequently
of its natural temperature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The pulse at the
beginning of the attack was sometimes full, tense and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
quick, but frequently weak; sometimes so low that
it could not be perceived without pressing the wrists;
and sometimes it had no preternatural quickness. In
many it intermitted after the fourth or fifth, and sometimes
after the fourteenth stroke. In some it was extremely
slow; even as low as thirty strokes in a minute.
The pulse was also <i>tense</i> and <i>chorded</i>. The
slow intermitting pulse was observed more frequently
in children than adults, and supposed to proceed from
a collection of water in the brain. Impressed with
this idea, I requested Mr. Coxe, one of my pupils, to
assist me in examining the state of the eye. For two
days we discovered no change in it; but on the third
day after we began to inspect the eyes, we both perceived
a preternatural dilatation of the pupils in different
patients; and we seldom afterwards saw an eye in
which it was wanting. In Dr. Say it was attended
with squinting, a symptom which marks a high degree
of a morbid affection of the brain. Had this
slowness or intermission of the pulse occurred only after
signs of inflammation or congestion had appeared
in the brain, I should have supposed that it had been
derived wholly from that cause; but I well recollect
having felt it several days before I could discover the
least change in the pupil of the eye. I am forced
therefore to call in the operation of another cause, to
assist in accounting for this state of the pulse, and this
I take to be a spasmodic affection, accompanied with
preternatural dilatation or contraction of the heart.
Lieutaud mentions this species of pulse in several places,
as occurring with an undue enlargement of this
muscle. Dr. Ferriar describes a case, in which a low,
irregular, intermitting and hardly perceptible pulse
attended a morbid dilatation of the heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
After the 10th of September this undescribable or <i>sulky</i>
pulse became less observable, and, in proportion as
the weather cooled, it disappeared. It was gradually
succeeded by a pulse full, tense, quick, and as frequent
as in pleurisy or rheumatism. It differed, however,
from a pleuritic or rheumatic pulse, in imparting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
very different sensation to the fingers. No two strokes
seemed to be exactly alike. Its action was of a hobbling
nature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was an alarming symptom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The pulse most frequently lessened in its fulness, and
became gradually weak, frequent and imperceptible
before death; but I met with several cases in which it
was full, active, and even tense, in the last hours of
life.</p>

<p>“Hæmorrhages occurred in the beginning of the
disorder, chiefly from the nose and uterus. Sometimes
only a few drops of blood distilled from the nose. As
the disease advanced, the discharges of blood became
universal. They occurred from the gums, ears, stomach,
bowels, and urinary passages. Drops of blood
issued from the inner canthus of the left eye of Mr.
Josiah Coates. Dr. Woodhouse attended a lady who
bled from the holes of her ears which had been made
for ear-rings. Many bled from the orifices which had
been made in performing venesection, several days after
they appeared to have been healed; and some from
wounds in veins made in unsuccessful attempts to draw
blood. These last were very troublesome, and in some
cases precipitated death.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“I was surprised to find so few marks of hepatic affection.
I met with but two cases in which the patient
could lie only on the right side. Many complained
of a dull pain in the region of the liver, but
very few complained of that soreness to the touch,
about the pit of the stomach, which is taken notice of
by authors, and which was universal in the yellow fever
of 1762. In proportion as the cool weather advanced,
a preternatural determination of the blood
took place to the brain and lungs. Many were affected
with pneumonic symptoms, and some appeared to
die of sudden effusions of blood or serum in the lungs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The disease seldom appeared without nausea or
vomiting. In some cases they both occured for several
days, or a week, before any fever took place.
This was more frequently the case where the disease
<i>was taken by exhalation from the putrid coffee, than by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
contagion</i>. The stomach was so extremely irritable as
to reject drinks of every kind. Sometimes green or
yellow bile was rejected on the first day of the disorder;
but I much oftener saw it continue for two days without
discharging any thing from the stomach, but the
drinks which the patient had taken. If the fever in
any case came on without vomiting, or if it had been
checked by remedies that were ineffectual to remove it
altogether, it generally appeared or returned on the
4th or 5th day of the disorder. I dreaded this symptom
on those days; for, though it was not always the
forerunner of death, yet it generally rendered the recovery
more difficult and tedious. In some cases the
vomiting was more or less constant from the beginning
to the end of the disorder, whether it terminated in
life or death. The vomiting which came on about
the 4th or 5th day was accompanied with a burning
pain in the region of the stomach. It produced great
anxiety and tossing of the body from one part of the
bed to another. In some cases this painful burning
occured before any vomiting took place. Drinks were
now rejected so suddenly as often to be discharged
over the hand that lifted them to the head of the patient.
The contents of the stomach were sometimes
thrown up with a convulsive motion which propelled
them in a stream to a great distance, and in some cases
all over the clothes of the by-standers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On
the first and second days many puked from half a
pint to nearly a quart of yellow or green bile. In
four (three of whom recovered) the bile, even at this
time, was black. On the 4th or 5th day a matter resembling
coffee-grounds was discharged.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many
recovered in whom this symptom appeared. Towards
the close of the disease there was a discharge of a deep
or pale-coloured black matter, with flakey substances
frequently swimming on the top of it.”</p>

<p>A quantity of grumous blood, dark coloured on the
outside, was frequently discharged by vomit towards the
end of the disease; and, along with all the discharges
from the stomach, there was occasionally a large worm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
and frequently large quantities of mucus and tough
phlegm. Our author supposes the black blood and
coffee-coloured matter to be different from that which
constitutes the true <i>black vomit</i>. This last he supposes
to arise in some cases from matter formed in consequence
of a mortification of the stomach.</p>

<p>The bowels were generally costive, sometimes with
extreme pain, tenesmus, and mucous and bloody discharges.
Sometimes the disease came on with diarrhœa,
principally in those who had weak bowels. Sometimes
there was a tension of the abdomen, with pain in the
lower part of it. Flatulency, chiefly in the stomach, was
almost universal in the disorder throughout all its stages.</p>

<p>The colour and consistence of the fæces was various
according to the mode of treatment the patient had undergone.
Where they were spontaneous, or brought
away only by gentle purgatives, their appearance was
natural; but when the patient was strongly purged, they
were dark-coloured, fœtid, and in large quantity. The
colour was sometimes green, sometimes olive. Their
fœtor was proportioned to the time they had been detained
in the bowels. In one case, where tonics had
been used, and the patient had no stool for several days,
a purge produced such an excessively fœtid discharge,
that the smell produced fainting in an old woman who
attended. Their acrimony was so great that the rectum
was excoriated, and an extensive inflammation sometimes
produced round its extremity. In some cases the stools
were as white as in the jaundice. Large round worms
were frequently discharged with them.</p>

<p>The urine in this disease was sometimes plentiful and
high-coloured, sometimes clear, and sometimes turbid;
sometimes discharged with a burning pain, as in a gonorrhœa;
sometimes it was suppressed; and in one case
the patient voided several quarts of limpid urine just
before he died.</p>

<p>Many were relieved on the first day by sweats, sometimes
spontaneous, and sometimes produced by diluting
drinks, or strong purges; sometimes of a yellow colour,
and offensive smell. Sometimes they were cold, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
the pulse was full at the same time. In general, however,
the skin was dry, and there were but few instances
of the disease terminating by sweat after the third day.
In some there was a great discharge of mucus from the
throat, occasioning an almost constant hawking and
spitting; and those always recovered.</p>

<p>In this fever, as in that of Boullam, and in the true
plague, people sometimes fell down suddenly in apoplexy,
syncope or universal convulsions. Some had
numbness and immobility of their limbs. Some had a
coma (a continual sleepiness) or an obstinate wakefulness;
the latter chiefly attended a state of convalescence.
In some the distemper began with a violent cramp in
the legs or arms. The last stage was attended with a
strong hiccup, which was a very dangerous symptom, as
indeed it is in all fevers. In some cases there was a deficiency
of sensibility, in others too much, so that the
mere motion of the limbs was attended with pain.</p>

<p>In this, as in the Boullam fever, the patient often manifested
a considerable degree of strength, even without
any delirium. One of Dr. Rush’s patients stood up
before a looking-glass, and shaved himself, the day on
which he died. A delirium, however, was common,
alternating in some cases with the <i>exacerbations and remissions</i>
of the fever, but in some continuing without
intermission to a few hours before death. Some had
maniacal symptoms, without any appearance of fever;
but in many the understanding was not impaired
throughout the whole course of the disease.</p>

<p>In this disease the pains in almost every part of the
body were very distressing. In those cases, however,
“where the system sunk under the violent impression of
the contagion, there was little or no pain.” In other
cases the patients were distressed with pains in their head,
particularly affecting the eyeballs. Sometimes it extended
from the back down the neck. A pain was felt
in the ears, as if they were drawn together by strings.
The sides, stomach, liver and bowels were all affected.
A burning pain in the stomach was sometimes so excessive
that the patient shrieked out violently. The back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
was often the seat of violent pain, which sometimes extended
from the back to the thighs; and the arms and
legs were sometimes affected in such a manner that one
patient said his limbs felt as if scraped with a sharp
instrument.</p>

<p>The thirst was generally moderate, but sometimes
otherwise; and, when excessive thirst came on in the
last stage of the disorder, it was a dangerous symptom.
Water was preferred to all other drinks. The appetite
for food returned much sooner in this than in other
fevers, and was excessively keen. Coffee was relished in
the remissions, in every stage of the disorder. Wine was
disliked, but malt-liquors were agreeable. In some
cases the recovery was attended with a great propensity
to venery, as in the true plague, but in an inferior degree.</p>

<p>In some cases the disease was attended with buboes
and glandular swellings. “I met with three cases (says
our author) of swellings in the inguinal, two in the parotid,
and one in the cervical glands: all these patients
recovered without any suppuration of their swellings.
They were extremely painful in one case, in which no
redness or inflammation appeared. In the others there
was considerable inflammation, and but little pain.</p>

<p>“Several cases of carbuncles, such as occur in the
plague, came under my notice. They were large, hard
swellings on the limbs, with a black apex, which, upon
being opened, discharged a thin, dark-coloured, bloody
matter. From one of these malignant sores an
hæmorrhage took place, which precipitated the death
of an amiable lady. A large and painful anthrax on
the back succeeded a favourable issue of the fever in
another patient. I met with a woman who showed
me the marks of a number of small boils on her face
and neck, which accompanied her fever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Notwithstanding
the disposition to cutaneous eruptions in
this disorder, it was remarkable that blisters were much
less disposed to mortify than in the common nervous
fever. Such was the insensibility of the skin in some
people, that blisters made no impression upon it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
In every case of this disorder which came under my
notice, there were evident remissions or intermissions
of the fever, or such symptoms as were substituted for
fever.”</p>

<p>The yellow colour rarely appeared before the third
day, and generally about the fifth or seventh day. The
eyes were not always affected with this colour. Sometimes
it appeared first on the neck and breast; and in
one case it appeared behind the ears and on the crown
of the head, which had been bald for some years. It
varied in the deepness of the tint, and sometimes disappeared
altogether; but, though some cases of great
malignity and danger appeared without any yellowness,
it was always a dangerous symptom when it appeared early.
The cause of this yellowness is by our author supposed
to be an absorption and mixture of the bile with the
blood.</p>

<p>After death the body appeared of a deep yellow
colour, sometimes a few minutes after death; sometimes
it was purple or black; and in one case yellow
above, and black below, the middle. In some it was
pale, as in common diseases, and many died with a
placid countenance as in natural sleep. In some the
body grew cold soon after death, in others not till six hours
afterwards, and in like manner stiffness occurred sometimes
in one hour, in others not till six. Where evacuations
had been procured, symptoms of putrescence
were longer in making their appearance than in those
who had used no medicines for that purpose. Many
discharged large quantities of black matter from the
bowels, others, of blood from the nose, mouth and
bowels.</p>

<p>“The morbid appearances of the internal parts of the
body (says the Doctor) as they appear by dissection
after death, from the yellow fever, are different in different
countries and in different years.” Dr. Mitchill,
in his history of the yellow fever in Virginia, in 1737 and
1741, informs us, that, in a female slave of forty, the
gall-bladder was outwardly of a deep yellow, but within,
full of a black, ropy, coagulated <i>atrabilis</i> (black bile)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
obstructing the biliary ducts. It was so thick, that it
retained its figure when the gall-bladder was opened.
It more resembled bruised and mortified blood than bile,
though it would stain a knife or probe of a yellow colour.
Two thirds of the liver on its concave surface were of a
deep black colour, and round the gall-bladder it seemed
to be mortified and corrupted. A viscid bile, like that
just described, was found in the duodenum near the gall-bladder.
The villous coat being taken off, the other
parts were found red and inflamed. The whole was lined
with a thick fur or slime. The omentum was so much
wasted, that nothing but its blood-vessels could be perceived.
The stomach appeared to be distended or swelled,
lined like the duodenum, containing a quantity of
bile even blacker than that in the bladder. It was inflamed
both on the outside and inside. The lungs were
inflated and all full of black or livid spots; and on these
spots were small blisters like those of an erysipelas or
gangrene, containing a yellow humour. The blood-vessels
in general were empty; only the vena portarum
seemed full and distended as usual. On cutting the
sound part of the liver, the lungs or the spleen, blood
issued freely.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackittrick found the liver sphacelated, the gall-bladder
full of black bile, and the veins tinged with a
black <i>fluid</i> blood. In all cases the stomach, duodenum
and ilium were remarkably inflamed. The pericardium
contained a viscid yellow serum, and in larger quantity
than usual. The urinary bladder a little inflamed; the
lungs sound.</p>

<p>Dr. Hume, of Jamaica, found the liver enlarged and
turgid with bile, and of a pale yellow colour; the stomach
and duodenum sometimes inflamed; and, in one
case, the former had black spots of the size of a crown-piece.
He had seen some bodies in which there was no
appearance of inflammation of the stomach, though the
patients had been afflicted with excessive vomiting.</p>

<p>Dr. Lind’s account is given on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_394">394</a>.</p>

<p>Drs. Physic and Carthrall, of Philadelphia, found the
brain in a natural state; the viscera of the thorax perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
sound; the blood in the heart and veins fluid,
similar in its consistence to the blood of persons who
have been hanged, or destroyed by electricity. “The
stomach and beginning of the duodenum are the parts
that are most diseased. In two persons, who died of
the disease on the 5th day, the villous membrane of
the stomach, especially about its smaller end, was found
highly inflamed; and this inflammation extended
through the pylorus into the duodenum some way.
The inflammation here was extremely similar to that
induced in the stomach by acrid poisons, as by arsenic,
which we have once had an opportunity of seeing
in a person destroyed by it. The bile was of its
natural colour, but very viscid.”</p>

<p>In others the stomach was spotted with extravasated
blood; and it contained, as well as the intestines, a black
liquor like that which had been vomited and purged before
death. The gentlemen were of opinion that this
must have been a secretion from the liver, as a fluid of
the same kind was found in the gall-bladder, of such an
acrid nature that it inflamed the operator’s hands, and
the inflammation lasted some days. The liver was of its
natural appearance, or nearly so. These dissections were
made early in the season; and at that time Dr. Rush is
of opinion that the disease was not attended with any
congestion in the brain, though it was so afterwards;
and accordingly we are informed that Dr. Annan attended
a dissection at Bush-hill, in which the vessels of
the brain were remarkably turgid. Dr. Rush, however,
is likewise of opinion, that the morbid appearances in
the brain may cease after death, as well as the suffusion
of blood in the face disappears after the retreat of the
blood from the extremities of the vessels in the last moments
of life. “It is no new thing for morbid affections
of the brain to leave either slender or no marks of disease
after death. Dr. Quin has given a dissection of
a child that died with all the symptoms of hydrocephalus
internus, and yet nothing was distinguished in the
brain but a slight turgescence of the blood-vessels.
Dr. Girdlestone says, that no injury appeared in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
brains of those persons who died of the symptomatic
apoplexy which occurred in a spasmodic disease which
he describes in the East Indies; and Mr. Clark informs
us that the brain was in a natural state in every
case of death from puerperal fever, notwithstanding it
seemed to be affected in many cases soon after the attack
of the disorder.”</p>

<p>With regard to the state of the blood in this distemper,
Dr. Rush says, that when drawn from a vein, it was,
“1. In the greatest number of cases, dense, and of a
scarlet colour, without any separation into crassamentum
and serum. 2. In many cases it did separate into
crassamentum and yellow serum. 3. In a few cases
the serum was of a natural colour. 4. There were
many cases in which the blood was as sizy as in pneumony
and rheumatism. 5. In some instances the
blood was covered with a blue pellicle of sizy lymph,
while the part which lay in the bottom of the bowl
was dissolved. In two cases the lymph was mixed
with green streaks. 6. It was in a few instances of a
dark colour, and as fluid as <i>molasses</i>. Both this and
the 5th kind of blood occurred chiefly where bleeding
had been omitted altogether, or used too sparingly, in
the beginning of the disorder. 7. In some patients
the blood in the course of the disease exhibited nearly
all the appearances which have been mentioned.
They were varied by the time in which the blood was
drawn, and by the nature and force of the remedies
which had been used in the disorder.”</p>

<p>From this account of the different appearances of the
blood, it appears to have varied at the very first attack
from an healthy state, and to have gradually deviated
from that state more and more, as the disease advanced.
Dr. Rush says<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> from Dr. Mitchill’s History of the Yellow
Fever in Virginia, in 1741, that “blood drawn
from a vein was always dissolved. The same state of
the blood was observed in many persons who had been
exposed to the contagion, who discovered no other
symptom of the disease.” In p.&nbsp;70 Dr. Rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
gives his own opinion in the following words: “I shall
say, hereafter, that the blood was seldom dissolved
in this fever;” and p.&nbsp;73, speaking particularly of the
blood, he enters into an argumentation against the
putrescency of that fluid. “It” (the blood) says he,
“has been supposed to undergo a change from a healthy
to a putrid state; and many of the symptoms which
have been described, particularly the hæmorrhages and
eruptions on the skin, have been ascribed to this supposed
putrefaction of the blood. It would be easy to
multiply arguments to prove that no such thing as
putrefaction can take place in the blood; and that
the symptoms which have been supposed to prove its
existence are all effects of a sudden, violent and rapid
inflammatory action, or pressure upon the blood-vessels;
and hence the external and internal hæmorrhages.
The petechiæ on the surface of the skin depend
on the same cause. They are nothing but effusions
of serum or red blood, from a rupture or preternatural
dilatation of the capillary vessels. The smell emitted
from persons affected with this disease was far from
being of a putrid nature; and, if this had been the
case, it would not have proved the existence of putrefaction
in the blood; for a putrid smell is often discharged
from the lungs, and from the pores in sweat,
which is wholly unconnected with a putrid, or perhaps
any other morbid, state of the blood. There are
plants which discharge an odour which conveys to the
nose a sensation like that of putrefaction; and yet
these plants exist at the same time in a state of most
healthy vegetation: nor does the early putrid smell of
a body which perishes with this fever prove a putrid
change to have taken place in the blood before death.
All animals which die suddenly, and without loss of
blood, are disposed to a speedy putrefaction. This
has long been remarked in animals that have been killed
after a chace, or by lightning. The poisonous
air called <i>samiel</i>, which is described by Chardin,
produces, when it destroys life, instant putrefaction.
The bodies of men who die of violent passions, or after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
strong convulsions, or even after great muscular
exertion, putrefy in a few hours after death. The
healthy state of the body depends upon a certain state
of arrangement in the fluids. A derangement of these
fluids is the natural consequence of the violent and rapid
motions, or of the undue pressure upon the solids,
which have been mentioned. It occurs in every case
of death from indirect debility, whether it be induced
by the excessive stimulus of contagion, by the volatile
vitriolic acid which is supposed to constitute the destructive
<i>samiel</i> wind<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> or by violent commotions excited in
the body by external or internal causes. The practice among
fishermen in some countries of breaking the heads
of their fish as soon as they are taken out of the water,
in order to retard their putrefaction, proves the truth
of the explanation I have given of its cause soon after
death. The sudden extinction of life in the fish prevents
those convulsive or violent motions which induce
sudden <i>disorganization</i> in their bodies. It was remarkable
that putrefaction took place most speedily
after death from the yellow fever, where the commotions
of the system were not relieved by evacuations.
In those cases where purges and bleeding had been
used it was much slower. There is a fact mentioned
by Dr. Ferriar, from Dr. Hamilton, late professor of
anatomy at Glasgow, which may seem at first to militate
against the facts I have mentioned. He says that
he had observed that bodies which were brought into the
dissecting room that had petechiæ on them were
longer in putrefying than any others. The fevers of
which the poor (the common subjects of dissection)
die, are generally of the low nervous kind. Great <i>direct</i>
debility is the characteristic of those fevers. The
petechiæ which occur in them appear in the last stage
of this direct debility. They are the effect, not of
too much impetus in the blood, as in the yellow fever,
but of a defect or total absence of it in the last hours of
life. The slow progress of the body to putrefaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
after death, in the instances mentioned by Dr. Hamilton,
seems to depend upon the same cause as that
to which I have ascribed it in those cases of death
from the yellow fever in which evacuations had been
used, viz. direct debility. In the former cases this
slowness of putrefaction is induced by nature, in the
latter by art. The effects of debility from both causes
are, notwithstanding, the same.”</p>

<p>From this long detail, in which the author’s meaning
seems rather involved in obscurity, we may gather that in
the fever of 1793 the blood had no determinate appearance,
but that, according to the action of the vascular
system, it was sizy or otherwise. This position, which
in my opinion is the meaning of the passage just now
quoted, is not supported by any facts. It is mentioned indeed
that the blood in some was sizy, in others quite fluid,
but as the cases in which it was so are not particularly related,
we do not know whether the action of the vessels
was stronger in those where the blood was fluid than where
it was not. Certain it is, that the blood may be made
fluid by certain substances mixed with it, without any
action of the vessels at all. The poison of the ticunas,
as well as all other animal poisons, renders the blood fluid,
yet this will kill instantaneously when injected into a
vein, before the vessels have time to act in such a manner
as could be supposed to change the texture of any of
the fluids<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> Or if this still will not satisfy, we are assured
that the poison of serpents, as well as many other substances,
which are not poisons, when mixed with the
blood taken out of the body, will prevent it from coagulating.
Granting, therefore, what hath not been proved,
that the greater the action of the vessels, the more fluid
the blood will be, yet we cannot know whether this fluidity
be occasioned by the action of the vessels, or the
action of the vessels by the tendency to fluidity in the
blood. But it matters not which of the two is cause or
effect: the question is, Whether in the yellow fever does
the ultimate effort of the disease tend to produce any
alteration in the texture of the blood to fluidity, or otherwise?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
This can be known only from considering the
symptoms which take place in the last stage of the disorder,
and from dissections. Now, from the concurrent
testimonies of all the writers quoted in this treatise,
it appears that towards the end of the disease there is
such a tendency to dissolution, that the whole body seems
ready to fall down into a putrid mass; or at least into
what is commonly called so, whether with strict propriety
of language or not, signifies little. In short, the difference
between the plague and yellow fever seems to be
entirely of the same kind with that taken notice of in
this treatise, p.p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_269">269</a>, 270, where the bile of a person
dying of a malignant fever was injected into the veins of
a dog. Here the blood was very fluid. In capt. Mawhood’s
case (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_385">385</a>) the blood flowed from his nose, eyes
and gums, besides what he discharged by vomit. Dr.
Lining (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_389">389</a>) attests a similar tendency to dissolution
in the blood in a most remarkable manner. See
also Dr. Lind’s opinion to the same purpose, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_393">393</a>, Dr.
Hillary’s, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_395">395</a>, Dr. Jackson’s account, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_399">399</a>, Dr. Chisholm’s,
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_411">411</a>; and lastly, Dr. Rush’s own testimony
concerning the hæmorrhages from all parts, lately quoted.</p>

<p>As we have formerly seen, that in the plague there
was no such tendency to dissolution, but rather to coagulation,
in the blood, it was thence concluded that the
immediate cause of the symptoms of plague is a tendency
in the blood to throw out the latent heat it contains,
by which means the parts on which these discharges fall,
are burnt up to a kind of cinder. In the yellow fever
the reverse takes place. The blood has a tendency to
absorb heat, and if it does so it must of course become
thinner, for this is the nature of all fluids, and indeed it
is abundantly manifest that fluidity in all cases is an
effect of the absorption of heat<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span> In consequence of
this absorption, the body towards the latter end feels cold,
the heat seems to retire from the extremities towards the
vital parts, and the vessels contracting and losing their
power by reason of the abstraction of sensible heat, the
pulse ceases entirely some time before death. Dr. Huxham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
takes notice of this excessive coldness in the limbs
taking place in a lady who died of a malignant fever, and
likewise that an intolerable stench issued from her body
for some time before her death, though kept clean with
all possible care. As the plague therefore is the highest
of all inflammatory diseases, so the yellow fever seems to
be the highest of the malignant class.</p>

<p>It may be objected, however, that as hæmorrhages,
petechiæ, black vomiting, and convulsions, sometimes
take place in the plague, we cannot from the existence
of similar symptoms in the yellow fever, conclude that
they are different diseases. But, with regard to the first,
it must be observed, that an hæmorrhage may ensue
from a rupture of vessels as well as from an oozing of
blood in consequence of an acrimonious thinness of
blood. It is indeed to be questioned, except in cases
where blood is discharged by the pores of the skin, whether
any hæmorrhage takes place but by a rupture of
vessels. In an healthy subject, hæmorrhages very frequently
take place from the nose where the blood is of
a very proper consistence; and Dr. Russel says that he
had occasion to see hæmorrhages from the nose and uterus
only; that in the advanced stages of the disease
though the blood was paler and of a <i>thinner</i> consistence,
the hæmorrhage was seldom profuse. It was, however,
of very bad omen; most of the cases in which it appeared
having terminated fatally.</p>

<p>That towards the end of this disease the blood should
begin to absorb the heat which it had before thrown out,
is not wonderful. A tendency to dissolution very probably
does in all cases take place in a greater or lesser
degree; but we have not any reason to suppose that in
the true plague hæmorrhages ever are as frequent, violent,
or attended with such an apparent tendency to
putrefaction, as in the yellow fever, and consequently we
must suppose that there is some <i>specific</i> difference between
the state of the blood in the one disease and in the
other.</p>

<p>Convulsions, though very frequent in the yellow fever,
yet, according to Dr. Russel, were very rare attendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
on the access of the pestilential fever. Even hiccup
was seldom observed, and sneezing not once. However,
he says that convulsive motions of the limbs were
frequently observed in the course of the disease; but
this is far from what Dr. Chisholm says of the Boullam
fever, where the patient expired in a violent convulsive
fit; or what Dr. Rush says of the fever of 1793, in
which the patient sometimes fell down in universal convulsions.
In short, the absence, or much less frequency,
of nervous symptoms in the plague, seems to constitute
another <i>specific</i> difference between the two.</p>

<p>With regard to black vomiting, it is neither peculiar
to the plague nor yellow fever. Dr. <span class="nowrap">Miller<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> has shown
that it may be occasioned by almost any kind of acrid
poison taken into the stomach. In proof of this he
quotes from Sauvages the case of a man who died in
consequence of taking a drachm of white arsenic instead
of cream of tartar, in whose stomach was found, on dissection,
a black liquor which deposited a sediment like
powdered charcoal. The villous coat of the stomach was
likewise abraded. For other cases of the same kind he
refers to Wepfer de cicuta aquatica, Morgagni, &amp;c. Another
case of poison by arsenic occurred in New-York
hospital, in which the patient had a black vomiting. In
another case in which corrosive mercury was swallowed
by mistake, the patient, after being to appearance in a
fair way of recovery, began to vomit a dark-coloured
matter, and died in a day or two. The agaricus clypeatus,
a kind of poisonous mushroom, brought on bilious
stools, locked jaw, vomiting, delirium, oppression of
the breast, sighing, anxiety, great prostration of strength,
yellowness on some parts of the skin, and death on the
sixth day. On dissection the stomach was found to be
inflamed, the duodenum distended with flatus, and the
gall-bladder full of green and black bile.</p>

<p>But the principal distinctions between the plague and
yellow fever seem to be the eruptive nature of the former,
and the propensity in the latter to attack strangers newly
arrived from colder climates; also in being more easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
checked by cold than the plague. It has already
been remarked from Dr. Russel, that of <i>two thousand seven
hundred</i> patients, whose cases he noted, every one had buboes.
These, however, were not all the cases he saw;
for he mentions some that had no eruptions; but from
this it is impossible to avoid drawing the conclusion,
that eruptions are the true characteristics of the plague.
Of these two thousand seven hundred, eighteen hundred
and forty-one had buboes in one or both groins; five
hundred and sixty-nine had them in the arm-pit; two
hundred and thirty-one had parotids; four hundred and
ninety, carbuncles; and seventy-four, spurious buboes.
Now, in all the number of cases of fever which Dr. Rush
attended in 1793, he had only two with buboes, and
one parotid; and as to the carbuncles they do not
answer the description of those in the former part of this
work<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> It is impossible therefore that any more clear
line of distinction can be drawn between the plague and
yellow fever. The following table, however, exhibiting
at one view the symptoms of the plague, the yellow
fever, fever of Boullam, and fever of 1793, will perhaps
set this matter in a still clearer light.</p>

<p>From a mere inspection of the detail of symptoms in
this table, the difference between the several distempers
is obvious. It is evident that none of them can with
any kind of propriety be called higher and lower degrees
of the rest. The plague is <i>essentially</i> different from the
other three, which seem indeed to be nearly allied; the
Boullam fever being only attended with more violent
and malignant symptoms. We ought now to enter
into a particular inquiry concerning the origin and nature
of these fevers; but, as a knowledge of this is in
some measure dependent on the question, whether or
not they are contagious, we shall in the first place
present the reader with the following extract from a
French treatise, in which the question seems to be handled
in an agreeable and judicious manner, and then
make another attempt, by an investigation of matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
fact, to determine whether the disease has ever been excited
by imported contagion or not:</p>

<p class="mb15em">“A very important question is&mdash;whether this disease
is contagious. The greater part of the American physicians
are of opinion that it is, and are persuaded that
it is brought from the West Indies, by the ships which
arrive here in the beginning of every summer. It is
even from that opinion, and on their vigorous representations,
that quarantines have been established, which
every vessel from the West Indies is obliged to perform
during 10 and sometimes 20 days at Fort Mifflin, several
miles distance from Philadelphia. This formality,
so troublesome to navigation, was observed this
year (1798) with more severity than ever it was; but
without answering any good purpose for the vessels;
for very few ships’ companies appeared taken with the
<i>yellow</i> or <i>putrid fever</i>. Nevertheless the epidemic,
whatever name it assumes, raged this year in Philadelphia
with more fury than even in 1793. Besides,
if the quarantine was a sure preservative, if almost all
the ships’ crews coming from the West Indies brought
the <i>yellow fever</i> with them, why should not <span class="smcap">Charleston</span>,
<span class="smcap">Norfolk</span>, <span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>, <span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>, <span class="smcap">Boston</span>
and <span class="smcap">Salem</span>, where no quarantines are performed,
be affected with the contagion, as well as New York
and Philadelphia? The American physicians are so
convinced that the <i>yellow fever</i> is contagious, that they
scrupulously prohibit persons in health from all communications
with those diseased; they order frequent
<i>waterings</i> in the streets and about the houses where
the fever has manifested itself, and aromatic fumigations.
They even order the clothes of those who have
fallen by it to be burned, as is practised with respect
to those who die with the plague. It must be confessed
that their precautions, in this respect, have in
some sort been justified, on seeing all the individuals
of one family successively taken with it, and often at
the same time, their neighbours, and so on, to a number
of people who might be authorised to attribute
their misfortunes only to their vicinage with the first
victims.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, if this distemper was as contagious as
certain physicians pretend, why should they not be the
first to be taken with it; they who see, examine and
touch many patients every day? Why should not
those who nurse them day and night, who continually
breathe those putrid miasmata; why should not those
who attend the hospitals, those who daily carry 30 or
40 coffins to the grave, be taken with it? We do not
hear, however, that the physicians, surgeons, nurses and
sextons have enlarged the funeral list more than any
other class of citizens. Some doubtless have fallen,
and perhaps they owed their death to their frequent
communications with the sick; but would the epidemic
have spared them in any other condition, more
than a number of unfortunate people who are neither
physicians nor nurses?</p>

<p>“Another particular not less remarkable is, that the
<i>yellow fever</i> seems hitherto to have spared the Frenchmen
who have resided in the West India colonies, the
greatest part of whom have nevertheless staid in New
York and Philadelphia during the <i>yellow fever</i>, and
have lived in the midst of the contagious air which
proves so fatal to the Americans. The result of all
this is, that, notwithstanding four years’ experience,
notwithstanding the public and private researches and
discussions which took place between the physicians
and philosophers of the American continent, there is
still much uncertainty on the nature of the distemper
which so rapidly depopulates New York and Philadelphia.
Every opinion, every system, presents palpable
contradictions, and is liable to objections which it is
difficult, not to say impossible, to answer in a satisfactory
manner. If the disease be contagious, why are
not the physicians, the nurses, the servants of the hospitals,
taken sooner than persons who have no sort of
communication with the sick?</p>

<p>“If it be not contagious, how happens it that the natives
of every age and sex, many of which, the women
and children especially, live in a pretty sober manner,
and seldom drink any of those liquors so liable to inflame
the blood, are taken with it, and fall, in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
all the efforts of medicine? How happens it that the
Europeans and Frenchmen who have never been in
the colonies are attacked like the Americans, whilst
the planters in the West Indies are spared?</p>

<p>“On the other hand, if, as the French physicians pretend,
this is nothing else than the malignant putrid
fever, often prevalent in Hispaniola, how happens it
that those medicines and that mode of treatment
which were so frequently successful in the colonies have
no sort of success when administered to Americans,
and seldom with Europeans? Why is this fever attended,
in its very first stage, with vomitings of blood,
bile, black spots, <i>purples</i> and other alarming symptoms,
which they frequently have at Hispaniola? How
comes it that the West India planters, who, while
they resided in the colonies, had frequent attacks of
putrid and often inflammatory fevers, enjoy the most
blooming health ever since they have been on the
American continent? And why are they not taken
with those putrid and inflammatory fevers, at a time
when those who have given them an asylum are the
daily victims of it? Finally, if we must attribute the
epidemic to no other cause than the immoderate heat
of the summer, which is really greater here for two or
three months than at Hispaniola, where a land and
sea breeze tempers its violence, why does it not stop
its ravages when the heat moderates? We have observed
in the epidemics of New York and Philadelphia,
that they were less destructive in the burning
dog-days than in the months of September and October,
when the mornings, evenings and nights begin
to be cool, and even cold enough to allow people to
go clothed as warmly as in winter.</p>

<p>“We have now a recent and striking example that it
is not heat only which causes the epidemics; since
there were only, in the month of September, three or
four days of great heat. The rest were very cool. It
may even be said that from the 22d it was cold, especially
on the 28th and 29th, when a violent north
wind obliged many people to have a fire. The number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
of deaths never were, however, so numerous as they
have been since the 20th of September. The funeral
list, which in July and August amounted to 40 per day,
reached on the 20th of September to 78, the 22d, 68,
the 23d, 71, the 24th, 63, the 25th, 80, the 26th,
77, the 27th, 96, the 28th, 106, the 29th, 76, and
from the 29th at twelve o’clock, to the 1st of October,
same hour, the number was 170; a number as
prodigious as it is frightful: we could not therefore
even flatter ourselves that the severest frosts of the end
of October would dispel the epidemic, did not experience
afford us that comforting hope.</p>

<p>“What then is the physical cause of this scourge,
which all human prudence and science are unable to
avert? The ministers of religion will not fail to ascribe
it to celestial wrath, and to advise prayers, fast
and charity to appease it. Those pious practices cannot
assuredly do harm; but the philosophical observer,
who does not conceive that Philadelphia and New
York should have excited the Heavenly wrath more
than those of other cities of the continent, will seek for
more natural causes, and will examine whether they
should not be attributed to some local and peculiar
vice of those two unfortunate cities, and perhaps to
the temperament, the diet, the mode of life, of their
inhabitants. Respecting this, we do not find, in the
<i>localities</i> of New York and Philadelphia sufficient
reasons, nor in the constitutions or mode of life of their
inhabitants sufficient variations, to mark them as the
victims of the <i>yellow fever</i>, while the inhabitants [of
other places] are free from it.</p>

<p>“I am however inclined to think that New York and
Philadelphia, more than any other cities, contain
causes of corruption or putridity, occasioned by their
size and the extent of their commerce, which, added
to the high mode of life of the Americans, may be
the source of the calamity which now affects them.</p>

<p>“In effect, we observe that in these two cities the
epidemic has constantly manifested itself in those parts
which are not only the most commercial, but also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
where the <i>common</i> sinks of the city meet; where the
houses, inhabited by the poorer class of people, being
smaller, and more crowded together; where the stores
contain most provisions liable to fermentation and putridity;
where the shipping crowded in the <i>wharfs</i>
render the water stagnant; where immense quantities
of dirt and litter are brought from every quarter for
the purpose of filling up new wharves and other places
designed to be taken from the sea, to enlarge lands
to build upon; finally, where the water used to drink
does not reach the pumps of the lower part of the
city until it has filtrated through the burying-grounds
and privy-houses of the upper parts, most of which
have no walls, and are never emptied.</p>

<p>“Let us add to all those causes of infection the dead
dogs, cats, pigs, and rats, which are thrown into the
common sinks and docks, the rotten fish, and the privies,
which in several houses, especially at New York,
are nothing but <i>tubs</i>, which are emptied weekly on
the sea shore, and we shall have less reason to wonder
at the putrid exhalations which issue on the eastern
part of New York, and at Philadelphia on that part
contiguous to the Delaware, and which are capable of
infecting the whole atmosphere, and to impair the
health of those who live in it. If the people who
dwell in those parts are not scrupulously sober, if they
frequently indulge in the use of spiritous liquors, if
they feed on such food as is generally known to be
unhealthy, is it to be wondered that, with such a
mode of life, their blood should be more disposed to
inflammation and to be dissolved and corrupted, in
the midst of an air already corrupted and loaded with
destructive miasmata?</p>

<p>“Now every man knows that those who live contiguous
to the river at New York, and the Delaware at
Philadelphia, mostly sailors, shipwrights, truckmen,
labourers, tavernkeepers, &amp;c. seldom trouble themselves
about the quantity of their foods and drinks,
but indulge copiously in the use of strong liquors, of
which an astonishing consumption is made in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
parts. They are not in other respects more careful as
to cleanliness in their narrow and low houses. There,
in a <i>hole</i> called a <i>bedroom</i>, and on a feather-bed half
rotted, in a heap of rags half devoured by insects still
more disgusting, two and sometimes three individuals,
covered with sweat, often drunk, sleep, and still increase
the filth by their shameful and dirty mode of
life. Shall we find it strange that those infected haunts
should shed forth in the morning a mephitic air, capable
of suffocating the most robust and vigorous men?
Shall we wonder that those who breathe this pestilential
gaz are suddenly seized with a fever? in itself perhaps
not very dangerous, if it were treated in a suitable
manner. But what is their method of treating it?
They do not even know the name of <i>ptisan</i>, still less
the use of <i>anodynes</i>, nor that of <i>salt of nitre</i>, nor of
<i>camphor</i>, so proper to prevent putridity. Punch,
made with rum; water mixed with gin and molasses;
a sort of soup made with Madeira wine; fish; raw oysters,
&amp;c. these are their first medicines. If their wives or
friends go to consult the apothecary, he advises the
<i>castor-oil</i>, or the famous calomel pills or powders, whose
virtues the quacks extol for every disease. Finally,
if the fever increases, the doctor is called, who administers
a light puke of 12 or 15 grains of tartar emetic,
a plenty of laudanum to procure sleep, and who,
seeing the case desperate, withdraws, saying that he
was called too late<span class="nowrap">!<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span></p>
<p>“Although the inhabitants of the other parts of the
city who are in better circumstances follow a mode of
life more regular, feed on more wholesome aliment,
and are much more cleanly in their houses (except however
<i>feather-beds</i> and <i>lower bedrooms</i>) it is nevertheless a
fact that they are much inclined, the men especially, to
eat salt meat, meat half cooked, green fruit, and still
more to drink spiritous wines. Several of them allow
themselves an immoderate use of the latter between dinner
and tea-time, the strength of which, added to that of
the high-spiced food, and liquors, must necessarily increase
in their blood that fermentation already excited
by the heat of the season. Now, shall we not
concede that bodies thus predisposed ought to be
more susceptible than others of the impression of the
corrupted <i>miasmata</i> which are constantly exhaled from
every thing that surrounds them; from the common
sewers, the wharves or the docks; from the dirt and
litter of the alleys and lanes; from the sulphureous
bilge-water of ships; from the cellars and from the
stores; in short, from those houses which contain sick,
dying and dead persons?”</p>

<p>Here the author, after stating objections on both
sides, seems at last to determine that the disease is produced
by putrid effluvia. The dispute on this subject,
however, hath continued so long, that we can by no
means expect to settle it in this treatise. At first view
one would think that nothing could be more easy than
to determine whether the disease arose soon after the arrival
of foreign vessels, or in places which had no connexion
with maritime affairs. But when we come to
particulars there is such a strange disagreement and contradiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
concerning facts, that we are in every instance
driven back into the wide field of theory and argumentation.
One instance of this we have already had in the
case of the Boullam fever said to be imported by the
<i>Hankey</i>. Let us now try another. Dr. Currie of Philadelphia,
in a letter to Mr. Wynkoop of date October
10th, 1797, says that the fever at New-York, of 1795,
was proved “by unquestionable facts,” to have been introduced
from Port au Prince by the brig Zephyr; and
for a proof of this he refers to a letter of the health
committee of New York to the governor, dated September
8th of that year. From this letter it appears
that Dr. Treat visited this vessel on the 28th of July,
where he found three men ill of what he called a bilious
<i>remitting fever</i>, and the body of one who died that
morning. Two days after, the Doctor was taken ill,
and died in eight days, with unequivocal symptoms of
yellow fever. On the 25th, four persons from on board
the ship William, from Liverpool, which arrived several
weeks before (the crew of which till this time had been
healthy) were taken ill of fever, and died with similar
symptoms in seven days. Nothing can be more direct
than this evidence, yet it did not give satisfaction.</p>

<p>The fact was impugned by the late Dr. E. Smith, in
a letter to Dr. Buel<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> who produces such evidence as,
in his opinion, “establishes it beyond a contradiction,
that neither Dr. Treat nor any other person contracted
a fever, such as prevailed in New York in
1795, from any sick or dead man, or any thing else
connected with the vessel in question.”</p>

<p>The evidence brought forward is the declaration and
deposition of capt. Bird. In a letter to Dr. Dingley,
the captain “thinks it his duty to contradict the report”
that Dr. Treat “caught the disease of which he died on
board the Zephyr.” He contradicts it by a deposition,
that “the mate and one mariner had the <i>fever and ague</i>
seventeen days on shore, and came on board with the
same disease; and the captain himself had a dysentery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
on his arrival in New York; and John Wheeler,
aged 16 years, died on the day of the arrival of the brig
in New York, by <i>worms crawling up into his throat, and
choking him</i>. He was sewed up in a piece of canvass,
and ready to be committed to the deep, when Dr.
Treat came on board, who desired the captain to have
the canvass opened, that he might inspect the body;
and he only cut the canvass over the face, but did not
make any other examination of the body.”</p>

<p>How far this proves captain Bird’s assertion, that Dr.
Treat <i>did not</i> catch the disease on board the Zephyr, the
reader will judge. It is, however, inconsistent with the
plan of this treatise to enter into an examination of contradictory
evidence concerning matters of fact. Accounting
as <i>nothing</i>, therefore, all that has been said, <i>by
either party</i>, concerning the brig Zephyr, let us proceed
to other testimonies.</p>

<p>In a collection of <i>facts</i> and <i>observations</i> by the College
of Physicians, published last year, we find the following
remarkable accounts tending to prove that the disease
was introduced by the ship Deborah, from Port au
Prince and Jeremie in St. Domingo: 1. In a letter
from Dr. Stevens to Dr. Griffiths it is stated, that “the
yellow fever prevailed in almost all the sea-port towns
in the French part of Hispaniola, particularly at Cape
Nichola Mole, where it raged so violently that it
obliged the British to abandon the post sooner than
they intended. About the same time it appeared in
the harbour of St. Thomas, and was so destructive to
foreigners, that it obtained the name of <i>the plague</i>.”
The Doctor saw several cases of it in St. Domingo,
during the months of August and September, 1798, and
“these were entirely confined to <i>American seamen</i>, while
the native inhabitants of the city were totally exempt
from it.” 2. From this very sickly coast arrived the
Deborah on the eighth of July. 3. On the 12th of
August John Lewis, mate of the Deborah, informed Dr.
Currie, that the vessel had lost <i>seven</i> persons with fever on
board during her passage, and one by accident; <i>and
that she had been employed as a transport in the British service</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
previous <i>to her taking in her cargo at Jeremie.</i> 4. Mr.
Thomas Town informed Dr. Wistar, that, on the first
of August, 1798, he was told by Alexander Philips, of
Water-street, that he (Mr. Philips) had brought up
two or three sick people from the Deborah, in one or
two boats. Some of them he had brought to his own
house; and one was dead. Philips himself was sick at
the same time, and died a day or two after. 5. Mr.
Purdon informed Dr. Currie that he had a similar account
from Mr. Philips, whom he saw on the first or second
of August in apparent good health, and that he
died on the Saturday following.</p>

<p>All this, and further evidence seemingly equally strong,
was set aside with the greatest facility by bringing counter-evidence,
particularly that of Mrs. Philips, who denied
that there were any sick people in the house; and
by bringing instances of the fever existing in town before
the vessel arrived. It is needless therefore to trouble the
reader with any further discussion of this evidence more
than the rest. As the ancient Britons, in their letter to
Aetius, lamented that the <i>barbarians</i> drove them to the
sea, and the <i>sea</i> drove them back to the barbarians, so
may we lament, in the present investigation, that the
uncertainty of theory drives us to <i>facts</i>, and the uncertainty
of supposed facts drives us to <i>theory</i>. Still, however,
we shall not despair. The introduction of a disease
into a large city is much more difficult to be traced than
in a smaller one. In the year 1794 the disease appeared
in the town of New Haven in Connecticut. Dr. Monson
of that place informs us, that it appeared on the 10th
of June, when Mrs. Gorham, residing on the <i>Long
wharf</i>, was visited by Dr. Hotchkiss, who found her affected
with symptoms of the yellow fever. In three days
her complaints suddenly vanished, and she was supposed
to be in a fair way of recovery, but the same evening she
vomited matter resembling coffee-grounds, and died next
day. On the same day that Mrs. Gorham died, Dr.
Monson visited her niece, a girl of eight years of age, who
had staid a week with her aunt, and was taken ill
three days before. The day after the Doctor saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
her she was suddenly relieved as her aunt had been,
but in a few hours vomited matter like coffee-grounds,
and died next day. These and some other similar cases
having alarmed the select men, inquiry was made, when
“it appeared, that, in the beginning of June, capt.
Truman arrived from Martinico, in a sloop that was
infected with the contagion of the yellow fever; that
this vessel lay at the <i>wharf</i>, within a few rods of Mrs.
Gorham’s residence; that she had on board a chest of
clothes which had belonged to a mariner who died
of the yellow fever in Martinico; and that his chest
was carried into Mr. Austin’s store, and opened in
presence of Capt. Truman, Mr. Austin, Henry Hubbard,
and Polly Gorham: the three last died in a
short time after their exposure to the contents of the
chest. Hence it is highly probable that Mrs. Gorham
caught the disease from the infected sloop or
clothing. Mr. Austin’s store stands within three or
four rods of Mr. Gorham’s house; and no person in
town was known to have the yellow fever previous to
capt. Truman’s arrival.”</p>

<p>In his further account of this fever Dr. Monson shows
that it was contagious in the highest degree, and that
Mr. Gorham’s house proved a kind of seminary from
whence the disease spread itself. “June 26 (says he)
Isaac Gorham lost an infant child with the yellow fever;
and soon after his son and daughter were affected
with it: the former died. Solomon Mudge died
on the 30th; Jacob Thomson’s negro woman on the
1st of July; Archibald McNeil on the 9th; Polly
Brown on the 3d of August; John Storer, jun. and
John Hide, on the 8th; and widow Thomson on the
10th. Jacob Thomson’s negro woman, Solomon
Mudge, John Storer, jun. and John Hide, had visited
Mr. Gorham’s house a few days before their illness;
Polly Brown and Mrs. Thomson nursed in Mr.
Gorham’s family; and Archibald McNeil nursed
Solomon Mudge. Elias Gill died on the 12th of
August, and Samuel Griswold’s wife on the 7th:
the former visited Mr. Gorham’s house, the latter
nursed in his family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>

<p>“There were a number of persons who caught the
disease at Mr. Gorham’s house, and recovered.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Thomson, on the first day of her illness, was
moved half a mile from Mr. Gorham’s, into George-street.
Luther Fitch caught the disease from Mrs.
Thomson, and communicated it to his servant maid.
Both recovered. Mr. Fitch lives in College-street,
nearly three quarters of a mile distant from Mr. Gorham’s
house. I could trace the disease throughout
the town. No person had the yellow fever unless in
consequence of attending the sick, or of being exposed
by nurses, infected houses, clothing, or furniture.</p>

<p>“I have inquired of several aged persons in this town
relative to the yellow fever, whether they knew of its
having ever been here previous to June 1794, and
there is but a single instance; the facts relating to
which are these: In the year 1743 a transient person,
by the name of Nevins, who came from the West Indies,
lodged at the house of Nathaniel Brown, an inn-keeper
in this city. The man was taken very sick in
the night, and died shortly afterwards; and his body
was very yellow after death. Mr. Brown’s wife sickened
in a short time, and died of the same complaint, which
was at that time supposed to be the yellow fever.</p>

<p>“I am credibly informed that several persons at Mill-river,
in Fairfield county, and also at New London,
died with the yellow fever in August and September,
1795. It was propagated there by infected persons
from New York.</p>

<p>“Capt. John Smith died in this town, the 20th of
August, 1795. He caught the disease in New York,
and communicated it to one of his negro servants.”</p>

<p>On the whole, Dr. Monson concludes, “that the yellow
fever is seldom or never generated in this country,
and that it is always imported from abroad. An objection
to the idea of its being generated in this country
is, that it was never known in the interior of this
state, or of the United States, so far as I can learn.
Had it ever appeared in Connecticut before the year
1743, and June 1794, we should undoubtedly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
had some record of the fact. There is no such
record, and no person remembers to have heard of
such a disease, but at these periods, prevailing in any
part of the state. There are numbers of aged persons
in New Haven who remember the putrid ulcerous sore
throat, small pox, measles, dysentery, &amp;c. raging here
with great mortality, but have no recollection of any
yellow fever. Hence we may rationally conclude that
it never did appear in this state but in the years 1743
and 1794.</p>

<p>“It is evident, from facts before mentioned in this
letter, that the yellow fever was propagated in no other
way than by contagion, and that this is a <i>specific contagion</i>,
and no more diversified, in its operation on the
human system, than that of the small pox and
measles.</p>

<p>“If the citizens of large commercial cities were attentive
in tracing the origin of the yellow fever, on its
first appearing among them, they would often find
that the disease was imported. In some instances it
would be extremely difficult to discover the origin.
But the mischief lies in this; that the inhabitants of
such cities, whenever a contagious disease makes its
appearance among them, endeavour to suppress all
rumour of it, from an apprehension of alarming the
country, and injuring their commerce; unwilling
to believe that there is evil in the city, till the disease
spreads in every direction. Then, indeed, when it is
too late, they are solicitous in the use of means to arrest
its progress. As it extends itself slowly at first,
seasonable exertion might both detect its source, and
prevent its increase; but when it is diffused through
a city, it spreads with rapidity, and it is no longer possible
to discover where it began. But as, whenever
the yellow fever has appeared in the United States,
it has always been in sea-port towns, and originated
near wharves, docks, and warehouses, there seems to
be high probability that the disease is imported.”</p>

<p>The evidence here seems so strong, that no counter-evidence
that can be brought appears likely to invalidate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
it. The coincidence of the commencement of the fever
with the arrival of the ship hath not been denied, as in
other cases; and, though it has been attempted to prove
that a fever might have arisen from the quantity of putrid
or putrescent matters at that time in the town, yet
the circumstances of those who were present at the opening
of the chest of clothes being taken with the fever,
and those who were sick of it in so many cases infecting
one another, cannot by any means be overthrown. But
the fact is, that even those who contend most violently
against importation, do yet allow that it may in some cases
be so; but they contend that if proper care be taken
it will not spread. Dr. Smith in his letter to Dr. Buel
says, “that infection may be brought into any place
from abroad; that, under certain circumstances of the
place where it is introduced, it becomes very destructive;
but that, when these circumstances do not exist,
however the person immediately affected, if it be
introduced by a sick person, may suffer, it is harmless
so far as the general health of that place is concerned.
If the subject were viewed in this light, as most assuredly
it ought to be, the question of importation or
non-importation would sink into its merited insignificance.”
But, with due respect to the memory of Dr.
Smith, this must surely be accounted a very inconsiderate
mode of reasoning. In the instance he speaks of,
that of the Zephyr lately mentioned, he allows that Dr.
Treat <i>might</i> have caught the disease on board the vessel<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span>
“but (says he) as <i>no other</i> person is known to have been
infected by that vessel, and as the Doctor communicated
it to no person, the advocates for importation
would not be greatly benefited by the concession.”
Surely we must look upon the life of Dr. Treat himself
to have been a matter not entirely insignificant, and if
he caught the fever by going on board, a number of others
who went in full confidence of the <i>impossibility</i> of importation,
might have done the same. As far therefore
as the prevention of such accidents can be accounted a
matter of importance, it is also of importance to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
the doctrine of imported contagion. It is true, Dr.
Smith, in the passage just quoted, adds immediately after,
that “no such concession (with regard to Dr. Treat)
is necessary;” but, in p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_104">104</a>, he does make an ample concession,
as we have seen, viz. that the contagion may not
only be imported, but, under certain circumstances, <i>be very
active and destructive</i>. The question therefore rests here:
Can we at all times promise that, with the utmost care
that can be taken, the circumstances of a place may not
be such as to give activity to an imported contagion? In
the nature of things it is impossible that the docks,
wharves, streets and alleys of a large town can be absolutely
clean. It is equally impossible that <i>all</i> men can
be advised to be temperate, cleanly, and neat in their
lodgings; and we are unable to determine how far people
may deviate from the <i>rule of right</i> in those respects
without danger. Before any theory of this kind could
be supported, it would be absolutely necessary to bring
an unequivocal proof that yellow fever had been in <i>one</i>
instance at least produced by local causes; but this cannot
be done. Among the Hottentots, the dirtiest people
in the world, no such disease exists. Among the
peasants of Poland, who likewise live in a very dirty
manner, their mode of life is said to produce not a fever,
but a disease of the hair, called the <i>plica Polonica</i>.
In the Medical Repository, vol.&nbsp;i, p.&nbsp;276, Dr. Mitchill
of New York describes a disease called <i>elephantiasis, liktraa,
or scurvy</i>, occasioned by loathsome, putrefying diet,
such as rotten fish, fish-livers and roe, fat and train of
whales and sea-dogs, congealed sour milk, with little or
no vegetable provisions, and by exposure to wet and
cold. This disease prevails in Iceland, in the Ferro
islands, in two districts of Sweden, and in <i>Madeira</i>; yet
this disease is not the yellow fever, though it is said to
make the person afflicted with it more like “a putrefying
corpse than a living man.” The <i>cold</i> seems to be
assigned as a reason why the disease does not assume a
febrile form; but, however this may hold with Iceland,
it cannot with Sweden, where the summer is so hot, that
the sun has been said to set forests on fire. This is probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
a fable; but we are assured by Pontoppiddan, in
his Natural History of Norway, a country to the full as
cold as Sweden, that in summer the heat is very great.
His expression is, that it is enough to “make a raven
gape.” As to <i>Madeira</i>, where the climate is warm, there
can be no such objection. But a particularity of this disease
is, that it is infectious. Supposing then that by any
means it should be exalted into a fever, have we any reason
to imagine that in such a case it would lay aside its infectious
property? Surely not. If this then is the case with
a disease produced by the same causes with the yellow
fever, we have the very same reason to suppose that the
latter is infectious, as that the former would be so if it
could lay aside its present form, and assume that of fever.
Another proof that mere dirtiness cannot at all
times produce a distemper, or even propagate its infection,
may be deduced from the sixth case quoted p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_355">355</a>
from Dr. Russel, where he says that a poor Jewish family
lived in a place such as he had always considered as
one of the receptacles of contagion, yet only one in six
of those who remained in it was taken with the plague.
In all cases of plague, or of violent epidemic disorders,
it has indeed been observed that the poor were more
subject to an attack than the rich. This was so remarkable
in the plague of London in 1665 that Dr. Hodges
says it was called the <i>poor’s plague</i>; and Dr. Ferriar tells
us from Diemerbroeck, that in some parts of Italy it was
customary in the beginning of a pestilence to drive out
the poor; and likewise that this cruel expedient was used
at Marseilles. The bad success of the experiment at this
last place, however, shows that people of any description,
and in any circumstances, may be attacked. A very
probable cause, entirely distinct from any mode of living,
may be assigned in this case, viz. that the poor are more
exposed to infection than others, both from their circumstances
and their rashness; for it will be evident to
those who converse with the most uninformed people of
any country, that the Turkish notion of predestination
is far from being confined to Mahometans. It is not,
however, denied, that dirtiness, as well as other local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
causes, may do much hurt, and occasion the spreading of
a disease which otherwise would not spread; because
uncleanness of all kinds seems to be the proper vehicle
of infection, in which it appears to delight to take up its
abode. In the Medical Extracts, vol.&nbsp;ii, p.&nbsp;174, we
have from Goldsmith the following anecdote concerning
the concentration of pestilential infection in the plague
of London:</p>

<p>“A pious and learned schoolmaster, who ventured to
stay in the city during the plague, and took upon himself
the humane office of visiting the sick and dying who
had been deserted by better physicians, averred, that,
being once called to a poor woman, who had buried
her children of the plague, he found the room where
she lay so little, that it could scarce hold the bed on
which she was stretched. However, in this wretched
abode, beside her, in an open coffin, her husband lay,
who had some time before died of the distemper, and
whom she soon followed. What shewed the peculiar
<i>malignity</i> of the air, thus suffering from human miasmata
or effluvia, was, that the contagious steams had
produced spots on the very <i>wall</i> of their wretched
apartment. And Mr. Boyle’s own study, which was
contiguous to a pest-house, was also spotted in the same
frightful manner.” This shows not how infection may
be <i>produced</i>, but how it may be concentrated in such
miserable apartments. The appearance on the walls
brings to remembrance what is said in the book of Leviticus
concerning the appearance of the leprosy in walls
and clothes.</p>

<p>But, supposing we should allow that dirtiness may
bring on a yellow fever (and it is plain that this cannot
be proved) we have, in the case of the Busbridge Indiaman,
a <i>demonstration</i> that cleanliness cannot keep it off<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span>
This vessel sailed from England for the East Indies, in
the year 1792, much about the same time that the
Hankey sailed for the coast of Africa. She had on
board 264 people in all, viz. 109 belonging to the ship’s
company, 130 recruits, and 25 passengers. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
very boisterous weather at first setting out, but crossed
the equator on the 26th of May, where the weather was
sultry, with heavy showers of rain. The disease now
made its appearance first among the recruits, and in a
fortnight spread among the ship’s company. It was common
for six or seven to be attacked with it daily from
the commencement; “and in the space of twelve weeks
almost every person in the ship not only had laboured
under it, but many had suffered repeated relapses.”
For several weeks the weather was hot and sultry; but,
when in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, they
experienced a reverse, and were driven by a storm as
high as S. lat. 42. Here the thermometer indicated a
temperature only 13° above frost, but no material change
in the disease took place. Afterwards, when returning
into the warm latitudes, they experienced the sultry heats
of the Atlantic without any change either for the better
or the worse, and this for no less a space than three
months.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the disease, Mr. Bryce the surgeon,
though inclined to ascribe it to contagion, could not
trace it to any origin of that kind, as the vessel had been
six weeks at sea before it appeared. It “could not be
ascribed to want of air or cleanliness, as <i>every possible</i>
attention had been used to preserve these: the different
apartments were thoroughly cleaned and fumigated
with wetted gun-powder; the decks were sprinkled
with boiling vinegar; and the windsails were attentively
kept in order at each hatchway. Mr. Bryce is inclined
to conjecture that a peculiar combination in the
circumstances of diet, situation, and state of the atmosphere,
may have given rise to this calamity. But the
same combination of circumstances so frequently takes
place <i>without any fever</i>, that it appears much more
probable the disease had its origin either from an
<i>imported fomes</i>, or from a <i>fomes generated in some individual
in</i> the ship, from whence it was afterwards
propagated to others by <i>contagion</i>.” The disease produced
on board the ship was not contagious to the
people on board another vessel with whom they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
communication, nor to the people ashore among whom
the convalescents were put, nor to new passengers taken
on board the vessel in the East Indies; circumstances
certainly not a little surprising.</p>

<p>It doth not therefore appear, that, without the intervention
of some other cause, mere dirtiness can produce
the yellow fever. Let us next see what can be done by
confinement, want of air, or, as it has been lately called,
abstraction of oxygen. On this, however, we must observe,
that in all cases where people are allowed to
breathe, their lungs must be filled with the due quantity
of <i>some</i> elastic fluid. If the fluid they breathe contains
a smaller quantity of oxygen, it must contain a greater
quantity of something else. If a disease therefore is produced,
it must be occasioned by the <i>presence</i> of that
other fluid, as well as by the absence of oxygen. Now,
in confined air, we know that not only the oxygen is diminished,
and consequently a larger proportion of azote or
septon mixed with it, but in addition to this increased
proportion of azote, there is also a positive augmentation
of the deleterious part of the atmosphere by the effluvia
from the bodies of those who are confined. These effluvia,
as we have seen, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_90">90</a>, contain a great quantity
of fixed air. Others have shown that they contain also
azote; and it may be so; but still we are sure that the
fixed air predominates. Besides this, from the breath
we know that a great quantity of aqueous moisture proceeds.
Experiments on the action of these different
kinds of fluids are yet in an imperfect state, yet some
important facts relating to them are known. 1. Oxygen
breathed in great proportion produces an augmentation
of heat, and proves an universal stimulant. See p.
118. By itself it quickens the pulse<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> 2. Pure fixed air
breathed by itself destroys life with the circumstances of
increased heat, rarefaction of the blood, and rupture of
the vessels. See p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_206">206</a>. 3. The circumstances attending
death by breathing azote are not particularly recorded;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
but we know that by breathing an atmosphere lowered
by it the consumptive fever is not increased, but
diminished; and there is an account in the Medical Annals
of a person who was perfectly cured of a consumption
by the smell of the bilge-water of a ship. 4. It has
formerly been shown, from Dr. Black’s experiments, that,
when the vapour of water is condensed in the body, a
great quantity of heat must be thus communicated to
it. In confined air therefore there is a diminution of
the oxygen which produces heat; but there is an augmentation
of the fixed air and of the aqueous moisture
which increases it; so that, on the whole, the balance
must be considered as in favour of the augmentation of
heat in the human body; not to mention the quantity
of sensible heat continually added to the atmosphere by
that which evaporates from the body. This position,
however, doth not stand upon the uncertain ground of
theory; it is confirmed by the following remarkable
fact: Commodore Billings, who commanded a Russian
expedition fitted out by the late empress, found, in his
travels through the northeastern part of Asia, that the
cold of the atmosphere exceeded not only what was
known in other climates, but even what most people had
been able to produce by freezing mixtures. Dr. Guthrie
informs us that he was unable to produce a greater
degree of cold than 36 below 0 of <i>Reaumur</i>, though assisted
by 20 below 0 of natural cold, and the power of
all the freezing mixtures he knew. “How much then
(says he) was I surprised to hear Mr. Billings assert,
that some spirit thermometers which he had with him,
graduated according to <i>Reaumur’s</i> scale, were often as
low as 40° below the freezing point of water, that is,
8 deg. below the freezing point of mercury. And
once or twice he observed them at 42 deg. below the
<i>freezing point of quicksilver</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span></p>

<p>“During this severe cold (probably 42 below 0 of
Fahrenheit) the Nomade Tchutski (a wandering nation
on the northeastern extremity of the Asiatic continent)
who were conducting him along the coast of
the Frozen ocean, in sledges drawn by rein-deer, encamped
every night on the frozen snow in low tents,
which they quickly formed with the skins of rein-deer,
spreading some of them on the surface of the snow, on
which they all slept; and he assured me, that, so far
from suffering from cold during the night, the heat
was so excessive in these fur tents, where from ten to
fifteen slept together, according to its dimensions, that
no one could bear even a shirt; but all lay in a violent
perspiration, naked as they were born, till dawn
of day, without the aid of fire, excepting a train-oil
lamp, which lighted each tent.”</p>

<p>From this account it seems pretty evident, that, by
the accumulation of animal effluvia, a heat may be communicated
to the atmosphere greater than that of the
human body. We cannot suppose the heat of the tent
which put the people in a violent perspiration to have
been less than 90° of Fahrenheit; and, supposing the temperature
of the external atmosphere to have been at a
medium 30° below 0, there must have been a generation
of 120 degrees of heat; but the heat of the human
body does not exceed 97 degrees, and it cannot communicate
more heat than it has. But we must suppose
the tents to have been capable, had they been filled to
the top, of containing twice the number who did sleep
in them. They could communicate to the air therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
only one half of 97 degrees, or <span class="nowrap">48 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°; the remaining
<span class="nowrap">71 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>° therefore must been derived from the breath and
perspiration of the body<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now attend to the consequences which must
naturally and undeniably follow from this fact. If, in
such a violently cold climate, the effluvia of fifteen human
bodies could produce a heat sufficient to induce a
violent perspiration, what would they not have done had
they been in a climate where the heat of the atmosphere
was upwards of an hundred degrees greater, or between
70 and 80 above 0 of Fahrenheit? Perhaps this was
never thoroughly tried except in the black hole at Calcutta.
Here an hundred and forty-six men and one
woman were enclosed in a dungeon only 18 feet square,
and consequently affording scarce eighteen inches square
to each. This happened in a very hot climate, in the
month of June; so that we cannot suppose the temperature
to have been less than 80° of Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>On being confined in this manner, the vital powers
endeavoured, by a most profuse perspiration, to send off
the superfluous quantity of heat thrown into the body.
This was exactly what took place with Dr. Guthrie; but,
in the case of the black hole, there was, besides the
quantity of heat produced by the warmth and perspiration
of the body, <i>an hundred and ten</i> degrees more to be
added, on account of the natural heat of the atmosphere.
For we cannot suppose the heat at Calcutta, in a sultry
evening in the month of June, to have been less than
80, which added to &ndash;30, supposed to be the temperature
among the Tchutski, makes 110°. The perspiration
was extremely profuse, and was soon accompanied with
excessive thirst; nature being unable to supply such a
quantity of liquid, or this liquid to carry off the heat from
the body. The want of pure air began then to be felt
by a difficulty of breathing; and Mr. Holwell, having in
despair retired from the window, found the difficulty of
breathing increase, attended by a palpitation of the heart.
Aroused by his sufferings, he returned and was relieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
by drinking some water, and having air at the window.
The difficulty of breathing diminished, and the palpitation
ceased; but, finding the thirst not to be quenched
by water, he sucked his shirt-sleeves, which were wet
with sweat, and endeavoured as much as possible to catch
all of it that he could. The taste was soft and agreeable.
A pungent steam was now felt like spirit of hartshorn.
A number had died, and Mr. Holwell, once more rendered
desperate, retired from the window, and lay down
upon a bench, where he soon lost all sense. Next morning
only 23 survived, of whom Mr. Holwell was one.
He revived on being brought out to the fresh air, but
was instantly seized with a putrid fever, as well as all
the rest of the survivors. In this situation they were
obliged to walk, loaded with fetters, to the Indian camp;
at night they were exposed to a severe rain, and the day
following to a sultry sun; yet, notwithstanding this ill
treatment, they all recovered; having an eruption of
large and painful <i>boils</i> all over the body. Mr. Holwell,
however, said that he never afterwards enjoyed good
health.</p>

<p>Another melancholy proof of the bad consequences
resulting from a want of fresh air we have in the evidence
given by Dr. Trotter, when the question concerning
the slave trade was agitated before the British
House of Commons. He deposed that the slaves were
confined 16 hours out of 24, and permitted no exercise
while on deck. They were kept in rooms from 5 to 6
feet high, imperfectly aired by gratings above, and small
scuttles in the sides of the ship, which could be of no
use at sea. The temperature of these rooms was often
above 96 of Fahrenheit, and the Doctor says that he
never could breathe in them, unless just under the hatch-way.
“I have often (says he) observed the slaves drawing
their breath with all the laborious and anxious
efforts for life which are observed in expiring animals
subjected by experiment to foul air, or in the exhausted
receiver of an air-pump. I have often seen them,
when the tarpaulings have been inadvertently thrown
over the gratings, attempting to heave them up, crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
out, in their own language, ‘We are suffocated!’
Many I have seen dead, who, the night before, had
shown no signs of indisposition; some also in a dying
state, and, if not brought up quickly on the deck,
irrecoverably lost. Hence, in one ship, before her arrival
in the West Indies, out of 650 slaves, more than
50 had died, and about 300 were tainted with the
sea scurvy.”</p>

<p>A third example of the effects of want of air, though
conjoined with other causes, may be reckoned the case
of the Hankey, formerly related. The people there
were not indeed confined as much as in the black hole,
but it is impossible to suppose that there could be a proper
circulation of air, and the length of time the passengers
were confined might be equivalent to the violence
of the cause in the case of the black hole. In the latter,
however, the disease produced was not the yellow
fever, but seems to have been a kind of non-descript
eruptive one, more resembling the small pox, or rather
<i>Job’s disease</i>, than any other. From Dr. Chisholm’s account
of the Boullam fever also, it seems to have been
more of an eruptive nature than the common yellow fever;
so much, that Dr. Chisholm is of opinion that it
partook “in no small degree of the nature of the true
plague.” He says that in it he “did not observe <i>carbuncles</i>
on any who died; but that in many who recovered
they were numerous, large, and very troublesome.”
He considered them also as a critical discharge, and the
only one in this fever; but in the plague they certainly
are not; neither is it at all probable that they were of
the same nature with the pestilential carbuncles.</p>

<p>In p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_207">207</a> of this treatise it is inferred, from some experiments
of Dr. Davidson and Dr. Chisholm, that the fevers
in warm climates <i>are not</i> owing to a deficiency of
oxygen in the atmosphere; but in a treatise on the
yellow fever in Dominica by Dr. Clarke, we have other
experiments, which, if they can be depended upon, certainly
overthrow that doctrine, or at least render it very
dubious. Dr. Clarke endeavoured to ascertain the purity
of the air by Mr. Scheele’s apparatus, and which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
likewise used by Dr. Davidson, viz. filling gallipots with
flowers of sulphur and iron filings well mixed and moistened,
and putting these upon a stand under a glass vessel,
which was placed on a stool in a pail of water. The
glass vessel was marked and divided on the outside, and,
allowance being made for the space occupied by the
gallipot, the water rose only one fifth in the glass vessel,
after standing 24 hours. When the disease abated, it
rose near one fourth; and upon many trials afterwards
it never rose above one fourth. When the emigrants
fled towards the mountains, where the air is very pure,
they always avoided an attack of fever, or soon recovered
if in a convalescent state. This is similar to what is
stated by Van Swieten concerning the plague at Oczakow,
viz. that the atmosphere was so loaded with some
kind of vapour, that in certain parts of the town polished
sword-blades were turned black. This seems to have
indicated a great prevalence of inflammable or hepatic
air, or both, in the atmosphere; but it is extremely doubtful
whether this could produce a <i>fever</i>, much less the
true <i>plague</i>. In Dr. Clarke’s experiments it were to be
wished that he had examined the nature of that part of
the atmosphere which was left after the absorption of
the oxygen. It is by no means probable that at any
rate the addition of a fifth part of azote could have rendered
the air so unwholesome; and besides, we are entirely
at a loss whence to derive such an immense quantity;
for certainly the quantity of air which surrounds us,
even for a few miles extent, is so great, that any considerable
alteration in its composition could not take place
without a very evident cause. The probability therefore
is, that the experiments did not give an accurate
statement of the quantity of oxygen contained in the atmosphere.
Experiments on this subject must always
be uncertain; and of all the modes of trying the qualities
of the air, perhaps that with sulphur and iron filings
is most liable to variation. It may vary, from the
nature of the sulphur<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> from the cleanness or the impurity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
of the iron filings, or lastly from the accuracy of
the mixture. It is also a misfortune in this case, that
though a great absorption proves the existence of a large
quantity of oxygen in the atmosphere, yet a small one
does not prove the contrary; for it is more reasonable
to suppose that we have failed in our experiment, than
that the constitution of the atmosphere has changed.
Dr. Clarke’s experiments therefore cannot prove any
thing, until more accurate methods of investigating
these things be found out.</p>

<p>We must now proceed to investigate a third cause assigned
for the production of fever, and that is the putrefaction
of animal and vegetable substances. This hath
been very much insisted on. Dr. Rush ascribes the fever
of 1793 to the exhalations of putrid coffee, but allows
also the distemper to have been contagious, and says,
that “for several weeks there were two sources of infection,
viz. exhalation and contagion. The exhalation
infected at the distance of three or four hundred yards,
while the contagion infected only across the streets.
The more narrow the street, the more certainly the
contagion infected. Few escaped it in alleys. After
the 15th of September the atmosphere of every street
was loaded with contagion; and there were few citizens
in apparent good health, who did not exhibit one
or more of the following marks of it in their bodies:
1. Yellowness in the eyes, and sallow colour on the
skin. 2. Preternatural quickness in the pulse. 3. Frequent
and copious discharges by the skin of yellow
sweats. 4. A scanty discharge of high-coloured or
turbid urine. 5. A deficiency of appetite, or a preternatural
increase of it. 6. Costiveness. 7. Wakefulness.
8, Head-Ach. 9. A preternatural dilatation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
of the pupils.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many country people who
spent but a few hours in the streets in the day, in attending
the markets, caught the disease, and sickened and
died after they returned home; and many others, whom
business compelled to spend a day or two in the city
during the prevalence of the fever, but who escaped
an attack of it, declared that they were indisposed
during the whole time with languor or head-ach.”</p>

<p>Thus, according to our author, the fever of 1793 <i>began</i>
from putrid effluvia, and <i>was continued</i> by contagion.
But many attempts have been made to prove that
putrid effluvia <i>alone</i> both begin and continue it. The
limits of this treatise would not allow (even were it but
beginning) of a particular account of all that has been
said upon the subject; neither indeed is it needful. A
single well attested instance would decide the matter;
but we have already seen the difficulty of procuring that
instance on either side. Certain it is, that we have instances
of the yellow fever arising where it is not pretended
that there was any considerable collection of putrid
matters. In the Medical Repository, vol.&nbsp;ii, p.&nbsp;149, we
find an account of the yellow fever appearing “in a country
village, near a fresh river, <i>on low marshy ground</i>, seven
miles from Portland, so that no suspicion could arise
of the disease being imported. <i>Several other cases of
yellow fever</i> occurred <i>in different parts of the country</i>.”
This stands on the authority of Dr. Jeremiah
Barker of Portland, so that there can be no doubt of its
authenticity; and though it cannot prove that the yellow
fever <i>may not</i> arise from putrid effluvia, yet it certainly
shows that it <i>may</i> arise without them. It
does the same with marsh effluvia; for though we may,
in the case of the village, suppose that the marshy ground
on which it stands occasioned the disease there, yet what
shall we assign as the cause of its being dispersed in different
parts of the country, where there were neither
marshes nor rotten beef? The proofs indeed of animal
effluvia being the cause of yellow fever are so equivocal,
that Dr. <span class="nowrap">Davidson<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> supposes putrid <i>vegetable</i> matters to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
be more active in this way than the former. For this
supposition he gives as a reason, that Dr. Rush has observed,
that butchers, and those who lived in the neighbourhood
of shambles, scavengers, grave diggers, and
others of similar employments, escaped the yellow fever
in Philadelphia. These, the Doctor justly observes, were
more exposed to what he calls the <i>gazeous oxyd</i> of azote,
than any other class; and he likewise takes notice, that
sailors, who during long voyages feed on putrescent food,
which might be supposed to produce a great quantity of
this acid, are thence subject to scurvy, a disease not only
different from fever, but entirely opposite to it. This
exemption of people conversant among the dead has been
also taken notice of by Dr. Mitchill<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> who brings as
an argument against the contagious nature of the disease,
that “seven men belonging to the alms-house of New
York were employed, during the whole of the sickly
season of 1798, in putting the persons dead of the
plague (yellow fever) into coffins, and though they
handled in the course of their service upwards of <i>five
hundred</i> corpses, in different stages of putrefaction, and
though they were much incommoded with the pestilential
quality of the air in the rooms they entered, and
frequently were obliged to vomit, not one of them was
so much indisposed, during the whole season, as to
discontinue his employment.” This is no doubt a
very remarkable fact, but in the present instance it
proves too much; for if, from it, we conclude that the
disease is not contagious, we must also conclude that
it cannot be produced by putrid animal substances.
Yet in the very next sentence Dr. Mitchill assures Dr.
Currie, “that exhalations from corrupting <i>beef</i> and <i>fish</i>
have excited sickness as malignant, and as deadly, as
any which has occurred.” If exhalations from putrefying
beef and fish have produced this sickness, why did
not exhalations from putrefying <i>human bodies</i> do the same?
and if we are assured that the latter <i>did not</i>, we have as
little reason to suppose that the former <i>did</i>; unless we
establish a difference between the corrupting flesh of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
animal and of another, which no experience hath countenanced
in the least.</p>

<p>The exemption of those employed in burying the dead,
even in the true plague, is observable. Dr. Canestrinus
supposed it might be owing to the use of garlic, which
they were wont to bruise and rub their hands, face and
breast with, and likewise to chew, before they entered
into an infected house; but this cannot be supposed a
very powerful antidote. Dr. Rush is of opinion that
grave diggers escaped in Philadelphia by the circumstance
of their digging in the earth; and he says also
that scarce an instance was heard of those employed in
digging cellars being attacked with the disease. “There
seems to be something (says he) in the fresh earth,
which attracts, or destroys, by mixture, contagion of
every kind. Clothes infected by the small pox are
more certainly purified by being buried underground
than in any other way. Even poisons, are rendered
inert by the action of the earth upon them. Dogs
have long ago established this fact, by scratching a
hole in the ground and burying their limbs or noses
in it, when bitten by poisonous snakes. The practice,
I am told, has been imitated with success by the
settlers upon new lands in several parts of the United
States.”</p>

<p>This reason is very plausible for the exemption, of
such as work in the ground, from contagion; but it cannot
do for scavengers and butchers, who by the nature
of their employment are frequently exposed to steams
from the vilest matters. We may, on the contrary, derive
from thence a very strong argument that these
steams are by no means essentially connected with contagion.
We have already seen from Dr. Fordyce (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_169">169</a>
of this treatise) that contagion or infection is not
the object of sense. Dr. Rush, though he doth not
absolutely say that the contagion of the yellow fever
hath no smell, yet informs us, that “the smell of the
contagion, as emitted from a patient in a clean room,
was like that of the small pox<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> but in most cases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
a less disagreeable nature. Putrid smells in sick
rooms were the effects of a mixture of the contagion
with some filthy matters. In small rooms, crowded
in some instances with four or five sick people, there
was an effluvium that produced giddiness, sickness at
the stomach, a weakness of the limbs, faintness, and,
in some cases, a diarrhœa. The contagion adhered
to <i>all kinds of clothing</i>. It was in no instance communicated
by paper.” From so great authority we may
certainly conclude that, <i>according to the best observation</i>,
there is an <i>essential difference</i> between the contagion of
a disease and the effluvia of a putrefying carcase; and
that, though the latter may be the vehicle of the former,
and may increase its virulence, either by being partly
assimilated to its nature, or by affording it a proper <i>nidus</i>
for concentrating itself; yet that originally the one is
not the other; and, though contagion may bring on a
fever without putrid effluvia, yet putrid effluvia cannot
do so without contagion. With regard to pure contagion,
I shall here, to the evidences already produced,
subjoin the testimony of Dr. Davidson, formerly quoted.
“I must <span class="nowrap">declare<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> (says he) I have seen the disease evidently
propagated in this way (by contagion;) but in
many instances it could not be traced. I have known
three cases of the fever brought on by persons bathing
in the sea along side the vessel, some distance from the
shore, and neglecting to dry themselves properly afterwards.
The seminia of the disease were here present,
and, like the electrical jar charged, required
only the approach of a conductor.” This shows an
amazing subtilty and diffusibility in the contagion,
scarcely indeed credible, if it were not known to be
equally subtile in other cases. In the correspondence
between Dr. Haygarth, of Chester in England, and Dr.
Waterhouse, professor of medicine at Cambridge near
Boston, the latter informs us, from Dr. Rand, that by
burning, in a field near Charlestown, the bedding, furniture,
&amp;c. belonging to a person who had been ill of
the small pox, the people who lived in the wake of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
smoke proceeding from it were attacked with the small
pox, and the disease spread. This is similar to an observation
formerly quoted from Huxham; but the following
are much more remarkable: “A vessel arrived at
Charlestown from Lisbon, laden with salt, and lemons
in boxes<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> A person had the small pox on board,
and the small pox officers would not suffer the lemons
to be sold, without being first unpacked and the paper
surrounding each lemon taken off. These papers were
kept by themselves in a storehouse for several weeks;
and after this, by order of the overseers, they were
brought out and burnt; when, of two children playing
round the fire, one, named Manning, took the
disorder, and broke out at the usual time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“Dr. Rand was called to a lady, whom he found hot
and feverish with a violent pain in her head and back;
but he had no suspicion of the small pox. He bled
her, and a Mrs. Brandon held the vessel to receive the
blood, some of which spirted on her hand and arm.
Next day the small pox appeared on the lady who
was bled; and she was of course immediately separated
from Mrs. Brandon; notwithstanding, in twelve or
fourteen days, Mrs. Brandon was seized with the
small pox, and died. Several other persons present
were also liable to the infection, yet no one took the
disease but this woman, who stood over the blood
while it was running, and received some on her arm,
except Mrs. Benjamins, to whom the bason of blood
was handed over the bed, who also took the small pox
from the effluvia of the blood. The same physician
was called to the child of Manning (who was supposed
to have taken the small pox from the burning of
lemon-papers as aforesaid;) he found the child bleeding
at the nose in its mother’s lap, who was then in
the ninth month of her pregnancy. The next day
the small pox appeared on the child, and it was of
course immediately separated from its mother and all
the family; nevertheless, in about fourteen days the
mother was seized with the disorder, and not long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
after delivered of a dead child, which child <i>had distinct
eruptions over its whole body</i>.”</p>

<p>These facts are of the utmost importance in determining
the nature of contagious diseases. In conjunction
with others, they show that such diseases originate in
the blood, and from thence are communicated to the
rest of the body. They show also, that the contagion
is in all cases truly <i>specific</i>, and <i>immutable</i>. Thus the
contagion of the small pox, whether existing in the matter
of a pustule, in the smoke of burning clothes or paper,
or in the effluvia of blood, is invariably the same,
and never produces any other disease. It is the same
whether applied to the human body, or to that of a brute
animal; of which we have a remarkable instance in the
Medical Repository, vol.&nbsp;i, p.&nbsp;258. “A peasant of the
county of Essex, in England, seeing a great many
children carried off by the natural small pox, was desirous
of inoculating his two boys; one nine, and the
other twelve years old. Not being able to employ a
surgeon, he collected the scabs of a child then sick of
the disease, powdered them, and sprinkled the powder
upon slices of bread and butter. The two sons ate
them, and gave a bit to the house-dog. They had a
mild small pox, and got well without any remarkable
accident. The dog remained sick for two or three
days, drank a great deal, and refused to eat: on the
fourth he had a very decided variolous eruption: on
the ninth the pustules were full ripe, and dried up and
fell off like those of the two children. An English
author says he has seen the same epidemic in a flock
of sheep, the greater part of which were infected, and
communicated it to two cows, one of which died.
The symptoms that manifested themselves in these
animals in the course of the disease were in every respect
the same as in the human species.”</p>

<p>This instance, partly quoted in the former part of this
treatise, likewise is a strong proof of the contagion of small
pox being first communicated to the blood; for, by
swallowing it along with the aliment, it would, in the
common course of digestion, be absorbed by the lacteals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
and enter the blood with the chyle. The experiments
with dogs made by M. Deidier, of which an account
is given p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_268">268</a>, show that the contagion of the
plague is equally specific with that of the small pox;
and we see that it acted in all cases in which it was tried
by being mixed with the blood. Being thus first mixed
with the blood, it is plain that the contagion must have
passed from this fluid to all the other parts of the body;
and, if diseased blood is capable of communicating its
disease to all the sound parts of the body in which it
circulates, we must own that this strongly corroborates
Dr. Waterhouse’s suspicion, “that the blood is capable
of producing the infection before the disease is so far
advanced as to be apparent on the surface.” If the disease
originates in the blood, the latter should indeed
seem more capable of communicating it at first than
afterwards; because we must suppose that the diseased
parts would be thrown off to the surface, and so pass off
altogether. On this subject Dr. Waterhouse also quotes
the opinion of Dr. Holyoke of Salem, “who, for his
learning, professional abilities and integrity, is justly
esteemed one of the first physicians in this country,
and whose extensive practice has afforded him ample
experience in the small pox.” He writes to Dr. Waterhouse,
“that, although he has reason to believe that
an infected person seldom gives the disease till after
the eruption is considerably advanced, yet there are
facts which make it probable that it is sometimes
communicated earlier.”</p>

<p>In the same letter Dr. Waterhouse gives other instances
of the inconceivable subtilty of variolous contagion,
no less remarkable than those already mentioned. One
is of Dr. Brattle, who, having visited patients infected
with the small pox, “used the common precaution of
covering his clothes with a loose gown, &amp;c. but neglected
his <i>wig</i>. In consequence of this small neglect,
after riding six miles on horseback, he gave the disease
to a person in a room through which he passed, where
he did not stay to sit down.” Another is, if possible,
still more remarkable: “David Anthony, esq. one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
the overseers of the small pox in Rhode Island, after
going into the hospital, and using the common precautions,
neglected to <i>smoke his wig</i>. In his way home,
two miles from the hospital, he called at the house of
his daughter. He did not dismount, but sat on his
horse, and talked to her through an open window;
and, at the common period (by which we usually understand
about fourteen days) she took the disease
and died. Many such instances, adds the Doctor,
could I relate, where wigs have given the infection,
after being exposed to the open air during the passage
of several miles.”</p>

<p>From all this it appears how difficult a task they
undertake who contend for the domestic origin of the
yellow fever, without contagion. In all cases they must
have recourse to something visible and obvious to the
senses. Thus putrid beef, putrid fish, ponds of water,
marshes, &amp;c. are all easily seen, and we are able to prove
their absence as well as their presence. But we certainly
know that the yellow fever has arisen where none of
those supposed causes have existed, as in the Busbridge
Indiaman; and, on the other hand, all the supposed
causes have existed without the production of any fever.
Of this last Dr. Chisholm, in the conclusion of his defence
against Dr. Smith, gives the following remarkable
instance<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> “During a considerable part of the years
1776 and 1778 my duty led me very much to reside
in New York; and during my residence, particularly
in the summer and autumn of 1778, which were remarkably
hot, and insufferably so in the lower streets
of New York, no disease of a very alarming nature, and
none which assumed the form of an epidemic, appeared
among the troops or inhabitants. The smell from all
the ships, and from those in particular delineated by
Dr. Seaman (who has written a treatise on the subject)
was in the highest degree offensive. The police
at that time was by no means strict: putrid substances
of every description were accumulated in the ships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
and in many parts of the city unconnected with
wharves, and yet no disease was the consequence.”</p>

<p>Some particulars above related may perhaps appear,
to those who deny the existence of contagion, in rather
a ludicrous point of view. It is indeed too common
for people to laugh at what they cannot answer; but if
we consider the instantaneous and inexplicable action of
the poison of serpents, and in how little time they produce
a mortal disorder, or even death itself; when we
consider that contagion is only a volatile poison, and
that it for the most part takes up an incomparably longer
time to bring on death than the bites of some venomous
animals; we cannot be surprised that a quantity
of this volatile matter inconceivably less than that of
animal poison should be capable of bringing on the disorder;
for the length of time may be supposed to make
up for the deficiency of quantity. Yet, if we consider
the extreme activity of some animal poisons, the wonder
at the small quantity of contagion necessary to produce
a deleterious effect will in a great measure cease. In the
former part of this treatise it has been observed, from
Dr. Mead, that the whole quantity of poison emitted
by a viper, when it bites, does not exceed the bulk of a
<i>good drop</i>. An ordinary drop from a vial weighs half a
grain, so that we cannot suppose a large drop to be more
than a whole grain. But there are instances in which
effects equally deleterious are occasioned by the bites of
animals the whole bulk of which is scarcely equivalent
to that of the poison of the viper. In the northern climates
of the Old World, <i>spiders</i> do not grow to any remarkable
bulk, yet the bite of the poisonous spider of
Russia is as mortal as that of the rattlesnake<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> The
effect of the <i>furia infernalis</i> of Linnæus is still more to
our purpose. It is an insect found in the forests of Kemi
in Lapland, and likewise in Sweden and Russia; and,
if we can give credit to Mr. Pennant, in some of the Western
Islands of Scotland. This insect falls down out of the
air, and, if it happens to light upon any uncovered part
of the human body, it almost instantly penetrates down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
to the bone, occasioning the most excruciating pain, and
death in a <i>quarter of an hour</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> Now, should we suppose
the whole body of this insect to be poison, as it is
probable that it is not, it is so minute, that though the
whole were volatilized into contagion, it might be well
supposed to adhere to a <i>wig</i>, or even a more diminutive
part of the clothing; and, considering the virulent effects
of even this small quantity of contagion when concentrated,
it would easily follow by fair calculation, that
a very <i>minute proportion</i> of even this <i>small quantity</i> might
bring on a dangerous disease.</p>

<p>Lastly, it may be urged on the side of contagion that,
when a vessel arrives from a sickly country, it is no proof
that she has not brought a disease with her, that the people
aboard are in health. There is abundance of evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
that very dangerous maladies may be communicated
by those who do not labour under the same. The
prisoners at the Oxford assizes were not sick at the time
they communicated a dreadful distemper to those around
them. Dr. Brattle and Mr. Anthony were in perfect
health when they communicated the contagion of the
small pox, yet the effect was not less fatal. In short,
<i>contagion</i> being a power certainly known to exist, though
invisible and imperceptible, it is impossible ever to prove
that it is absent; neither after the contagion of any
disease has once got into a country can we be assured that
it may not revive. The experience, we may say, of the
whole world testifies that it does adhere particularly to
clothing. Dr. Lind thinks it may adhere to the timbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
of ships; and there is the greatest reason to believe that
it may also adhere to the walls of apartments in houses.
The appearance of fever therefore without any new importation
cannot prove that it has not arisen from contagion.
But it is now time to state the evidence on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>In Webster’s Collection we find the domestic origin
of yellow fever supported by Drs. Valentine Seaman,
and E.&nbsp;H. Smith of New York; and by Drs. Taylor
and Hansford, and Dr. Ramsay of Norfolk. Dr. W.
Buel of Sheffield has also given an account of a fever,
but so unlike that of which we treat, that what is said
of the one cannot be applicable to the other.</p>

<p>The arguments used by Dr. Seaman are, 1. Several
persons were infected, who had taken the utmost care to
avoid all communication with the sick, who had not
been for several weeks out of their houses, or within
<i>eighty</i> feet of an infected person. 2. The nurses and attendants
in some places were infected, but in others generally
escaped. Neither did the disease spread into the
country, as was reported; the Doctor having inquired
into these reports, and found them groundless. 3. Dr.
Lining says in his letter to Dr. Whytt<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> “If any person
from the country received it in town, and sickened on
his return home, the infection spread no further, not
even to one in the same house.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span></p>

<p>Several other arguments of the same negative kind are
adduced, which, being not essentially different from those
already quoted, it is needless to detail. The following
are rather of a different nature: 4. Some contagions
are propagated by contact only, others at a distance; but
at any rate we may suppose that contact will propagate
contagion more readily and more powerfully than any
other mode that can be imagined. Yet multitudes of
dissections have been made, and those who made
them are still alive. 5. “Specific and acknowledged contagions
all seem to arise from themselves only: hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
it would be almost as hard for me to believe that the
siphylis, small pox, or measles, could be produced
from any other cause than their own proper virus, obtained
from persons affected with the like disease, as
it would be for me to conceive of the formation of a
plant without its having received its seed, or <i>radical</i>,
from one of the same nature<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> Contagions seem to
fix in the soil of our bodies, and there seed, as naturally
and regularly as vegetables do on the earth. But
the yellow fever has been produced from <i>other causes
than contagion</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span> Does it not then admit of a doubt,
whether it <i>can possess</i> a power of propagating itself?”
7. Contagions respect no persons, but all of every clime
and colour are equally attacked with them; but the
yellow fever is known to attack some much more readily
than others. 8. Contagious diseases generally have a determined
time of invasion after an exposure to their cause:
but the advocates for contagion in the yellow fever cannot
be confined in this manner. “Their doctrine requires
that it (the contagion of yellow fever) be permitted
to act at any time between that of the exposure
and the sixteenth day; otherwise it would not embrace
cases enough to give it a currency.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> 9. “Contagions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
act more or less at all places and seasons, simply
of themselves, without the aid of any particular
circumstance of air or climate; but the supporters of
the yellow fever being contagious are obliged, <i>by the
force of the foregoing observations</i>, to acknowledge their
<i>imaginary fondling</i> to be but a <i>half-formed monster</i>, and
perfectly inactive without being assisted by the concurrence
of a predisposing constitution of the air.
(Rush on yellow fever.) This fever exists only in
warm weather: hence its cause in this city (New
York) was perfectly extinguished by the frosty nights
in the 10th month. It is confined mostly to low situations
in thick-settled places; otherwise our almshouse
and the surrounding country would have sadly experienced
its deleterious effects.”</p>

<p>This argument merits a particular consideration, as
involving a question of very great importance, namely,
concerning the constitution of the atmosphere, which
we have had occasion formerly to speak of, and which is
by some thought to be sufficient of itself to produce epidemics,
without the intervention of any other cause.
This constitution of the atmosphere is, it is true, something
<i>unknown</i>; and, when people appeal to it, it is only
in other words owning their ignorance; but the necessity
of recurring to some cause imperceptible by our senses
has in all ages been obvious. So much indeed has been
said in this treatise on the causes of plague (which may
apply also to yellow fever<span class="nowrap">)<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> that more would be superfluous,
even if our limits would admit of it. The dilemma
(and it is equally insoluble let us say what we
will) stands thus: If the yellow fever is produced by the
effluvia of marshes, by putrid streams, or by any thing
else, how comes it to pass that it has been so frequent in
the United States since the year 1792 in comparison of
what it was for 30 years before? Have the American
cities all at once become sinks of filth and nastiness?
Have the seasons been changed, or have the inhabitants
given themselves up at once to swinish intemperance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
gluttony, devouring, like savages, their meat half-rotten,
half-roasted or half-boiled? From some declamatory
publications indeed one might be apt to think that the
authors certainly meant to bring such accusations against
them. But it undoubtedly will be found an hard matter
to prove that the general cleanliness of the country
is inferior to what it was, or that the people are less virtuous
than they were before. Besides, has not the vigilance
of the magistrate, ever since 1793, been exerted to
the utmost to procure a removal of those nuisances from
which the disease might be supposed to arise? Yet their
efforts have not availed; for it is confessed that the attack
in 1798 was the most severe ever experienced.
If cold could have exterminated the disease, certainly
the three last winters have been abundantly sufficient to
do so; yet it is certain that cases of the fever did appear
in the end of December last, when the cold must certainly
have been deemed sufficiently intense to put a
stop to putrefaction of every kind. No wonder then
that people, unable to see the causes of these things,
should have recourse to something invisible, which they
called the <i>constitution of the atmosphere</i>. On this subject
Dr. Haygarth of Chester makes the following objections
to the commonly received opinions concerning epidemic
constitutions of the atmosphere<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span></p>

<p>“1. Dr. Odier of Geneva, in a letter to Dr. Haygarth,
writes thus: ‘I believe it would not be difficult
to prove that the state of the atmosphere is in no respect
the cause (of the regular epidemics of that city;)
for the villages and towns which surround it do not
experience the same epidemic all years as Geneva, although
they are situated under the same heavens, and
exposed to the same vicissitudes of atmosphere.’ 2. Sydenham
conjectures that some effluvia, issuing from
the bowels of the earth, produce epidemics. Were
this true, it might advance one step towards a solution
of the difficulty by discovering a local difference in the
atmosphere. But it has never yet been pretended that
any such vapour was perceived. Yet every part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
the earth must be capable of furnishing it; as no portion
of the whole habitable globe has been discovered
where the air could not propagate the small pox.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
3. Hence we may safely conclude, that the slight variations
of the same climate, and the same season, must
be altogether insignificant and nugatory. What important
difference of atmosphere can be supposed to
exist for weeks or months together in two neighbouring
villages, or in the adjacent streets of the same
town? This remark is plainly applicable to the propagation
of the plague and other infectious distempers.
Yet the latest and most respectable authors continue
to be misled by this groundless hypothesis.”</p>

<p>Objections of this kind do not solve the difficulty.
The excessive disparity of seasons with respect to the
spreading of epidemic diseases, the long cessation of them
at some times, and their sudden revival, as if with redoubled
fury, at others, indicate the operation of some
cause invisible to us; but whether that cause resides in
the earth or in the air, cannot easily be known. As
contagious matter seems to operate by being received
with the air into the lungs, it would seem rather probable
that the ultimate cause of epidemics resides also in the
air. Dr. Haygarth complains that the <i>vapour</i> arising
from the earth, supposed to produce epidemics, should
be invisible; but the contagion of the small pox, or of
any other infectious disorder, is equally so. It must, he
says, be diffused all over the earth. The electric fluid is
so; it issues from the earth in every part of its surface,
as is demonstrated by the common experiments of electric
machines; and there are the strongest reasons to believe
that it issues at some times and in some places in
much greater abundance than others. But enough has
been said on this subject; we must now consider matters
a little more obvious.</p>

<p>Though it is not easily seen in what manner the proportion
of the ingredients which compose the atmosphere
can be changed, and we are unable to discover the operation
of the more subtile fluid contained in it, yet we
are certain that its constitution must be different in different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
parts of the world. Islands, from their being
surrounded on all sides by the sea, must of consequence
have an atmosphere considerably different from that of
the internal parts of continents, where the air always
passes over large tracts of land. Hence the continent of
America, being situated between the two vast oceans
called the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Pacific</i>, must possess a constitution
of atmosphere considerably different from that of
the Eastern. Of consequence, the diseases of Europe
and Asia, when transplanted to America, or to the
American islands, will probably, sooner or later, assume
a type different from that which they had in their own
country. Dr. Waterhouse has taken notice of this in
his letter to Dr. Haygarth, and thinks that it may hold
good even in the small pox. “May not the small pox
(says he) operate differently in the two countries? It
has certainly had a different appearance, and required a
somewhat different treatment, almost every time it has
come among us. That the difference in the virulency
of the small pox, observed at different periods, when
epidemic here, may be attributed to a peculiar constitution
of the atmosphere, no one seems to doubt;
and why may not the difference, so reasonably to be
expected between the atmosphere of your island and
this continent, allow us to suppose that there is some
difference in the facility of receiving the infection?”
This is also an important consideration, and may throw
some light on the cause, as well as the mode of prevention,
of this disease.</p>

<p>Lastly, Dr. Seaman attempts to disprove the authenticity
of some cases which have been brought as positive
proofs of the disease having been received by infection.
These belong not to us to consider; it being impossible,
by reason of the invisible nature of contagion, to determine
from a simple consideration of any patient’s case
whether it was infectious or not. Dr. Fordyce has laid
down the proper rule for judging in such cases<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> One
only of the instances brought by Dr. Seaman therefore
we shall mention, and that, not because it proves any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
thing, but on account of its singularity. “Daniel Phœnix,
city-treasurer of New York, is supposed without
doubt to have taken his complaints from contagion:
the corporation, some time past, having issued into circulation,
for the accommodation of the inhabitants,
a great number of paper penny bills, it has been concluded
that he must have received contagion through
the medium of some bundles of these bills, which he
opened, that had been nearly worn out, to be exchanged,
and which he opened and examined to ascertain
their amount some days after he had received them.”
The Doctor allows that he might have been infected by
the bills, but ascribes it to putrid effluvia<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Smith, in his letters to Dr. Buel, insists much on
the vitiated state of the atmosphere, and is at some pains
to describe the persons who were most subject to it.
These, in 1795, were for the most part <i>foreigners</i>; under
which denomination the Doctor comprehends those
who came from other states, from the West Indies, and
from Europe, or who had not been many months or
years settled in the city. The number of citizens who
suffered he does not suppose to have exceeded one in
seven; but he remarks, that, both among foreigners and
citizens, the severity of the disease fell chiefly on the
poor. This mixture of different nations he accounts,
and with great probability, one of the causes of the distemper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
In confirmation of it he quotes Dr. Blane, on
the diseases of seamen, remarking, “that it sometimes
happens that a ship, with a long-established crew, shall
be very <i>healthy</i>; yet if strangers are introduced among
them, who are also <i>healthy</i>, sickness will be mutually
produced.” The same observation is made by Dr.
Rush, who, besides a general reference to the history of
diseases, adds the following remarkable fact: “While
the American army at Cambridge, in the year 1775,
consisted only of New England-men, whose habits
and manners were the same, there was scarcely any
sickness among them. It was not till the troops of the
eastern, southern and middle states met at New York
and Ticonderoga, in the year 1776, that the typhus
became universal, and spread with such peculiar mortality
in the armies of the United States.”</p>

<p>This confirms the observation made in the former
part of this treatise, when speaking of the English embassy
to China. It may likewise with probability be
assigned as one reason why large manufactories are generally
so unhealthy. In them there always is a collection
of people from many different and distant parts; and
what holds good on a large scale must also do so on a
smaller one. But this does not disprove the doctrine
of contagion, but rather confirms it; for, if the discordant
effluvia rising from healthy bodies of different <i>constitutions</i>
can <i>generate</i> a disease, much more may we suppose
the effluvia from sick persons capable of continuing
and propagating it.</p>

<p>Now, let us consider the account, imperfect as it is,
which we have been able to collect concerning the appearance
of the yellow fever on the Western Continent.
We have seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_377">377</a>, n.) that, at the time the plague
was in England, five of the Americans were transported
to that country; two of whom, after staying some time
in England, were sent back, with other strangers, to
America. This first colony having failed, another was
sent; the Indians went to war among themselves, and
the yellow fever is supposed to have made its appearance.
Here a suspicion naturally arises, that a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
pestilential taint had been imported by some of these
strangers, and that what would have been the <i>true
plague</i> in Europe or Asia, by reason of the peculiar constitution
of the atmosphere in the New World, there became
the <i>yellow fever</i>. The same may be said of the
original importation of it into Martinico. Sauvages
expressly says it was the <i>plague</i> which was imported.
Moseley and others deny that any such disease as the
yellow fever exists in Siam; and indeed it seems at
any rate to be a new disease. It seems <i>possible</i> that
diseases may change their nature; and Dr. Ferriar has
given a dissertation on the conversion of diseases. As
therefore the true plague never made its appearance in
America or the West Indies, it seems not unreasonable
to suppose that these countries are incapable of receiving
it, but that the pestilential poison, when transported to
the Western Continent, may assume a different, and in
many respects an opposite, nature; the two diseases being
thus like the opposite poles of a magnet, scarce agreeing
in any thing but the common work of destruction.</p>

<p>It is needless to spend time in attempting to investigate
the cause of this disease appearing at different periods.
That of 1793 has been the most remarkable and
the most destructive; the disease having never since that
time ceased its ravages. Previous to its appearance at
Philadelphia that year, Dr. Rush observes, that, “during
the latter part of July, and the beginning of August,
a number of the distressed inhabitants of St. Domingo,
who had escaped the destruction of fire and
sword, arrived in the city. Soon after their arrival the
influenza made its appearance, and spread rapidly
among the citizens.” The yellow fever quickly followed;
for on the 5th of August the Doctor mentions
his being called to his first patient. To the same purpose
we are informed by Dr. Clarke that “the fever made
its appearance in Dominica about the 15th of June,
1793, a few days after the arrival of a great number of
French emigrants. They were not sick, and the fever
had not made its appearance in Martinique when they
left it. From the 1st of July to the 1st of October it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
was computed that eight hundred emigrants, including
their servants and slaves, were cut off by this fever;
and about two hundred English, including new comers,
sailors, soldiers and negroes, all fell victims to it
in the same space of time. Few new comers escaped
an attack, and few recovered. It spared neither age
nor sex among the Europeans and emigrants; and not
only the people of colour from the other islands, but the
new negroes who had been lately imported, were all
attacked. Such as had been long on the island
escaped.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span></p>

<p>These facts seem to point out one of the causes, and
very probably a principal cause, of this dreadful distemper.
They show very evidently that there is a connexion
between war and diseases. It has formerly been attempted
to point out a natural connexion between the
horrid practices of men, on these occasions, and the
production of disease. These investigations, however
chimerical they may be reckoned, are yet supported by
many facts, which undoubtedly prove that mankind
cannot always maltreat and torment one another with
impunity. The affair of the Black assizes, and Old Bailey
session, in 1750, shows, that by confinement and
bad usage the human body, without being apparently
deprived even of health, may become poisonous to those
around it, and produce dreadful diseases. In like manner
the inhabitants of St. Domingo, having been put to
the most dreadful distress, became properly fitted for
spreading destruction wherever they went<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> It is even
probable that, in proportion to the degree of distress suffered
by these people, the disease communicated by
them will be malignant; nay, that new diseases may
spring up, which cannot be treated with success by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
method yet known to physicians. With regard to the
disease in question, it seems plainly to have from some
cause or other received an additional malignity. Dr.
Chisholm says that what he calls the Boullam fever was
supposed in Grenada to have been the common yellow
fever of the West Indies engrafted on the jail fever. Dr.
Lind, Dr. Jackson, and even Dr. Chisholm himself,
agree that the former is not infectious: but from what
has been already said the evidence seems to prevail in
favour of the opinion that the latter is so. Should we
then allow that two kinds of this fever might exist at
the same time, in one city, the difficulty would be at
once removed. But this has been reckoned by many,
particularly by Dr. Rush, as totally inadmissible; and
indeed it is a maxim consonant to general experience,
that two epidemics cannot exist in one place at the same
time, or that two diseases can scarcely exist at once in
the human body. This however must be understood,
principally at least, of acute diseases, or such as affect the
whole system; for if any disease of a particular part shall
take place, it does not seem impossible that a fever may be
superadded to such local disease. The following considerations
may perhaps throw some light on the subject:</p>

<p>It appears from the experiments of Dr. Adair Crawford,
that, when animals are immersed in hot water, the
blood drawn from a vein is of a florid red colour. In
summer it is likewise observed to be of a more florid colour
than in winter. If heat thus gives a more bright
red to the blood, it undoubtedly also makes it more
fluid, and in proportion to its fluidity it will likewise become
acrimonious; though this acrimony is not necessarily
connected with a florid colour, as the blood of
the arteries is not more so than that in the veins. In
the yellow fever, however, the blood sometimes, towards
the end of the disease, becomes endowed with extreme
acrimony. Dr. Smith, in one of his letters to Dr. Buel,
observes, that “blood drawn in the fever of 1795 was
remarkably <i>wanting</i> in floridity; especially what was
evacuated towards the close of the disease, whether by
art, or spontaneous effusion. In one instance it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
endowed with a caustic quality, and affected a lancet
so as to leave a permanent discolouration and inequality
on its surface.” He observes also, nay, considers it as
<i>demonstrated</i>, that the yellow fever <i>is not</i> a disease of vascular
debility, and he says that it is attended with an
astonishing <i>fluidity</i>, or, as it is called, <i>dissolution</i> of the
blood. Every one therefore who comes from a cold to
a warm climate must in some degree or other have his
blood liquefied, and in a certain proportion rendered
more acrimonious than before. This acrimony may be
undoubtedly augmented by certain causes, and by none
more probably than immoderate drinking of spiritous
liquors. Every one therefore who comes from a cold
country to a warm one, especially where the air is also
moist, may consider himself as already diseased, at least
in comparison with what he was when at home. For
the blood is now exposed to a greater degree of heat,
and consequently is about to absorb, or rather may be
considered as in the act of absorbing, more, and consequently
of changing from a thicker to a thinner or
more fluid state; the latter being the natural situation
of the blood in warm countries. Dr. Rush, in his inquiry
into the proximate cause of fever, has accounted
for the dissolved appearance of the blood in malignant
fevers to a tendency in the blood-vessels to paralytic affection.
He says that “it (the dissolution of the blood)
begins in the veins, in which muscular action is more
feeble than in the arteries. This has been proved by
Dr. Mitchill in his account of the yellow fever in Virginia
in 1741. He found the blood to be dissolved
when drawn from the veins, which, when drawn from
the arteries of the same persons, exhibited no marks
of dissolution.” This, as the Doctor observes, “is a
fact of great importance;” only we must remember,
that, in every thing relative to the human body, when
we find two phenomena constantly accompanying each
other, it is extremely difficult for us to determine which is
cause or effect. Instances of this often occur; and in the
present case the dilemma is as great as any other. Though,
from the testimony of Dr. Mitchill, we cannot doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
that in yellow fever the dissolution begins in the veins;
and though it is likewise extremely probable that this
dissolution is attended with a paralytic tendency, we
cannot know whether the dissolution is the cause of the
paralytic tendency, or the paralytic tendency the cause of
the dissolution. The point, however, is of no importance.
We see that in warm climates the blood of
a person newly arrived has a natural tendency to dissolution,
and of course the veins to the paralytic affection
just mentioned. The liver therefore, which
is supplied with blood by a large vein branched out
like an artery, and terminating in other veins to carry
back the blood from the former<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> must be much
more affected than any other part of the body; and this
indeed seems a very probable reason why all those who
come to warm countries become much more inclined to
bilious complaints, which denote an affection of the
liver, than they were before. This hepatic affection
may very probably be greatly augmented, in new comers,
by various causes. One of these is hard labour under a
greater heat than they have been accustomed to; a
second, that in the West India islands they have not
access to that plentiful supply of fermented liquor, abounding
in fixed air, which they had at home. This,
though not generally taken notice of, is far from being a
matter of little consequence; for, though emigrants from
Britain and Ireland have been for the most part accustomed
to drink spiritous liquors, yet fermented malt
liquors certainly constitute the principal part of their
drink. The total want of these, and the substitution of
ardent spirit and water, must certainly be detrimental,
even though they keep within the bounds of moderation,
and much more if they do not. Dr. Moseley relates<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span>
from Dr. Irving, that, in a bad kind of intermittent
which broke out among the troops in service on the
Spanish main in 1780, “nothing was so grateful as <i>London
bottled porter</i>. Wine was neither so much desired
by the sick, nor so serviceable in corroborating and
keeping up the powers of the stomach; which, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
the rest of the body, was soon reduced, from the
slightest indisposition, to the lowest state of debility.”
A third cause is no doubt their frequently drinking too
freely of spiritous liquors, perhaps not of the best quality;
and which, as they are neither conjoined with the
fixed air nor with the mucilage which as it were inviscate
and blunt their force in malt liquors, cannot fail of
exerting their deleterious properties in a very remarkable
manner.</p>

<p>From these and other causes there must necessarily
arise a predisposition to hepatic diseases; and this predisposition
cannot be removed until the blood has assumed
the state of fluidity proper to the climate in which
they are, and the body has acquiesced in the change.
They are then said to be <i>seasoned</i> to the climate; and it
is seldom that this seasoning takes place without a disease;
indeed so seldom, that the first illness which happens
to seize them after their arrival is called the <i>seasoning</i>.
Dr. Trotter indeed gives a very different account
of this seasoning. He considers those who come from
a cold to a warm climate as having a redundancy both
of excitement and excitability, and says that “to <i>wear
out this accumulated excitability</i> by slow and gentle gradations
is the grand explanation of the word <i>seasoning</i>:
it is the <i>secret</i> which constitutes the only difference between
the inhabitants of England and Jamaica. The
yellow fever of the West Indies therefore, as it appears
in the body of a raw European, is a disease of the
<i>utmost excitement</i>, in a constitution of <i>accumulated excitability</i>;
where a tense fibre and dense blood permit it
to be carried to the highest pitch of inflammatory
tendency; which, from the nature of the animal economy,
speedily exhausts the powers of life, even in a
day or two, inducing putrefaction and death.”</p>

<p>Explanations of this kind may edify those who understand
them; but, though we should declaim ever so
much about excitement and excitability, it is plain,
that, in every one who comes from a cold country to a
warm one, the liver is affected in a manner that the rest
of the body is not. In some constitutions, or from exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
causes in any constitution, this affection of the
liver may be augmented, and no doubt at last produce
a bilious fever, which may be varied in a number of
ways, according to the nature or the energy of these
causes. The pure bilious fever, being of itself properly
a local affection, may not be contagious; and we find it
generally agreed among physicians that the common
yellow fever of the West Indies is not infectious. Nevertheless,
it seems by no means improbable that from
certain circumstances contagion may be joined with it,
and it may then spread and infect, even as the most
deadly plague. Dr. Crawford relates, that, in the year
1770, a new kind of fever broke out in the Middlesex
Indiaman, of which many died. It is not said that the
disease was contagious; but, on opening the bodies of
some who died, the liver was found enlarged, and of a
more florid colour than it ought to be. It cannot be
deemed impossible that contagion, even that of the true
plague, might be mixed with this fever, which (as
the affection of the liver was probably the original
disease, might have been accounted little other than
symptomatic) would then have assumed very malignant
symptoms.</p>

<p>We might now say that we have got to the end of
our subject. Having so amply discussed the question
concerning contagion, and stated the principal part of
the evidence against it, it seems proper to conclude the
section with a short history of the disease in the malignant
form it has assumed in the United States since the
year 1792. Still, however, it is necessary to say something
further of one or two of the causes which have
been commonly assigned as necessarily inducing this
disease. These are, 1. Extreme heat, and, 2. Marsh
effluvia. The effect of the former has already been
partly considered as a predisponent cause of yellow fever:
but it doth not appear that merely from this cause the
disease has ever been produced. It hath indeed been
observed by very intelligent physicians, that in Virginia
the remitting fever has often been brought on by mere
exposure to the sun. Dr. Oliver of Salem hath obligingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
informed me, that he has “in more than one instance
been seized with that disease after riding in the
sun;” and that an eminent practitioner in Virginia had
informed him that he had also more than once suffered
in the same way. Drs. Taylor and Hansforth observe,
that, when the remitting fever proves mortal, it is generally
attended by sickness and perpetual vomiting;
which is the termination of the yellow fever. The above
evidence is decisive with regard to heat being able to
produce a remittent, but cannot exactly apply to the
yellow fever, which has no remissions. Two sailors indeed,
lately brought from a coasting vessel to the Salem
hospital, were attacked with violent symptoms of yellow
fever without having been, as is said, exposed to any infection.
But evidence of this kind cannot be supposed
to be incontrovertible. We have already seen the difficulty
of ascertaining <i>facts</i>; and if it is difficult to prove
that contagion <i>has</i> been received, it must be still more
so to prove that it <i>has not</i>. The persons in question had
both worked during a very hot day in a vessel’s hold,
they afterwards sat exposed in the damp air of the evening
on the deck until 10 o’clock at night, and then slept
in the vessel’s cabin with the windows open. One of them
was seized in the night with a most violent pain, and the
other on the morning succeeding. It is said that about
11 months since this vessel was at New York, and that a
person on board had the yellow fever; it is also alleged
that the vessel was not purified, and that the beds remained
on board. It has therefore been by some conjectured
that the disease might have been derived from
this source.</p>

<p>Dr. Ramsay, in a letter to Dr. Currie of Philadelphia,
censures Dr. Lining for saying that the yellow fever was
imported into South Carolina. “The greater yellowness
of the skin (says he) appears to be the only circumstance
in which it differs from the bilious remittent fevers
of hot climates, or very hot seasons of any climate.”
Our author also censures Dr. Lind of Haslar<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span> who, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
says, has been misled by the <i>misrepresentations</i> of Dr.
Warren and others. He also gives into the opinion that
contagion acts only by contact, or at a very little distance;
but this subject we cannot enter farther into at
present. If we can believe Dr. Moseley, the sure criterion
by which the yellow fever may be distinguished
from any other is, that the former hath no remissions<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>
If solitary cases of it appear in Carolina and the
southern States every year, this will not prove that the
disease was generated in the country, any more than that
the plague was generated in London, because it appeared
there for many years successively.</p>

<p>But, if the heat of the sun cannot produce the true
yellow fever, it can kill suddenly without any fever
whatever. This is said by Dr. Moseley to be less frequent
in the West India islands than on the eastern and
western continents. He says that he has felt as great
inconvenience from the sun’s heat at Venice, Naples,
Rome, Montpelier, and in Virginia, as in the West Indies<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span>
but he concludes that the <i>transitions</i> from heat
to cold are more pernicious to the human body than any
continued heat, however violent.</p>

<p>With regard to the effluvia of marshes, it is not denied
that they produce fevers, but those fevers are of the
intermittent or remittent kind. Dr. Smith indeed, in
the first volume of the Medical Repository, labours to
prove that the plague described by Thucydides was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
essentially different from the fevers which sometimes prevail
in North America, and that it had its origin from
marsh effluvia and the ravages of war. That this distemper
was not the plague described by Russel we may
gather from a single circumstance: for Russel tells us
that <i>sneezing</i> never occurred in the plague described by
him<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> while Thucydides says that it was one of the common
symptoms of his. Neither does the description of it
(Appendix No. 1) at all agree with any of the accounts
of the yellow fever we have. The climate of Attica no
doubt was variable, and may in this respect resemble
that of North America; but so is the climate of China,
yet no such diseases are there produced. The Doctor
concludes that the distemper originated from <i>local</i> causes;
but the difficulty we find in proving such origin of diseases
in our own days, and in the country where we reside,
must certainly make us look upon the proofs which
can be brought for the local origin of a disease which
happened two thousand years ago, and in a distant
country, as very equivocal. The following extract from
the Paris Medical Memoirs may be adduced as a proof
of the intrinsic power of marsh mud to produce fevers.
It is contained in a paper written by Dr. Perkins of Boston.
“A farmer was in the practice of spreading, upon about
thirty acres of land, some new marsh mud, from October
to April annually, to increase the fertility of the
soil. In the summer of the third year, those inhabitants
who lived to the northward and eastward of the
place were attacked with a very malignant fever, which
generally proved mortal. What is a proof that the
marsh mud was the cause of the disease is, its extent,
which was not more than a mile and an half from the
farmer’s house, in the direction of the southerly and
westerly winds. Perhaps had this marsh mud been
washed by plentiful rains, the danger would have
been less. Something like it happened to the inhabitants
of the marshes <i>in East Sudbury</i>, (les marais situes
a l’est dans le Sudberg) where the passage for the waters
was too deep, and too confined. In regular seasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
they were attacked with simple intermittent fevers;
but, after wet seasons, there prevailed among them malignant
fevers, and very obstinate remittents. Since
the marshes have been drained, the inhabitants are no
longer subject to fevers, and are as healthy as those of
others places. We know that there are local epidemics,
which are produced by a low, wet and rich
soil; such are, probably, those which prevail in the
lower part of New York, which, according to the informations
obtained by Mr. Perkins, is more unhealthy
towards the end of the summer than the other part
of the city, and whose inhabitants are subject to diseases
of a putrid <i>caractere</i>.</p>

<p>“It appears, from several observations, that the most
mortal epidemic fevers are not commonly produced
by causes operating immediately; the cause often existing
several months before the disease even appears.”</p>

<p>The other arguments used by Dr. Smith in his letters
to Dr. Buel proceed upon the state of the city, the mode
of living, &amp;c. and the condition of most of the emigrants,
their bad accommodations, and especially their
abuse of spiritous liquors. The neglect of bathing is
also much complained of, and a comparison made with
the conduct of the French in this and other respects,
greatly to the advantage of the latter.</p>

<p>Drs. Taylor and Hansforth consider the disease which
took place in Norfolk in Virginia as only an higher degree
of the common remittent fever which usually prevails,
and ascribe it to the long-continued heat, putrescence,
&amp;c. Some French ships were said to have
brought the disease, but these arrived “so long before
the disease appeared, that (the Doctors think) it would
be absurd to suppose even a possibility of its being derived
from them.” Mr. Webster adds, in a note, that
the French corvettes, three of which squadron were
taken by the Thetis, capt. Cochran, “anchored in
Hampton Roads, May 18th. The fever did not
appear in Norfolk till August. Captain Cochran’s
crew, however, <i>took the fever from the French prisoners</i>,
and twelve of them died before the Thetis reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
Halifax.” This is certainly a suspicious circumstance.</p>

<p>Dr. Ramsay, in his letter to Dr. Mitchill concerning
the same distemper, observes that it was confined almost
entirely to foreigners, of whom he gives a very unfavourable
account. The situation of the town, putrescence,
&amp;c. are likewise brought in for a share, as well as
the season, which had been uncommonly warm.</p>

<p>These are the principal evidences that have been
brought for and against the origin of the disease which
since 1792 has raged with such violence in the United
States. Innumerable pieces have appeared in the Newspapers
on both sides of the question, the most remarkable
of which are the letters of Mr. Noah Webster to Dr.
Currie. These, however, we cannot now consider, as we
cannot expect indeed that they should contain any thing
else than a fuller detail of what has already been set forth.
Mr. Webster besides, in his letters, owns that he is not a
medical man; nay, that he had not “read above three or
four medical books.” I hope therefore the reader will
excuse the preference given in this treatise to the writings
and arguments of those who are acquainted with medicine
both by reading and practice. The dispute between
the College and Academy of medicine can be settled only
by themselves; the only safe line of conduct seems to be
to admit both doctrines, and to take every method of
preventing the introduction of the disease, whether supposed
to be generated or imported.</p>

<p>Whether the distemper which has so fatally prevailed
since the year 1793 be naturally connected with the
troubles in Europe and the West Indies or not, it is certain
that it has been cotemporary with them. In New
York the disease appeared in 1791, but we are not furnished
with any particular accounts of it at that time;
nor does it appear to have made any great ravages, either
on the continent or the West India islands, till 1793.
At this time the war raged in Europe with fury; the
French royalists were every where driven out, and distressed
in every possible way. Desolation and slaughter
prevailed at St. Domingo, while an unbounded intercourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
took place between the United States and all those
nations who were involved in the calamities resulting
from the unbridled passions of man excited to
their utmost pitch of ferocity. In the midst of this general
commotion the fever broke out in the West India
islands, appearing first in the island of Grenada. We
have seen, that, according to Dr. Chisholm, this disease
was brought to Grenada in the Hankey, from the coast
of Africa, on the 18th of February. About the middle
of April it began to appear on land. In the beginning
of May it reached a detachment of the royal artillery
lying at a distance from the focus of infection, “but
(says Dr. Chisholm) by the communication which the
gunners in Fort George had with the 45th regiment,
and the predisposition of the men to receive the infection
as far as that could be induced by excesses in
drinking, and other irregularities.” About the first of
June the disease began to appear among the negroes of the
estates in the neighbourhood of the town, but never attacked
them with the same violence that it did the
white people. During the months of May, June and
July, it appeared in different parts of the country; being,
as our author supposes, carried thither by infected persons.
From Grenada, the Doctor says, the disease
spread to the islands of Jamaica and St. Domingo, and
from the latter to Philadelphia, “by vessels on which
the infection was retained by the clothes, more especially
the woollen jackets, of the deceased sailors.”</p>

<p>This account of the origin of the fever at Philadelphia,
as we have already seen, is inadmissible by those who
deny the contagious nature of the disease; but as the
latter have never given any distinct account of its rise, or
shown why it should first appear in one island and then in
another, instead of beginning in them all at once, we
must adhere to that of Dr. Chisholm, till we are furnished
with a better.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia it has already been observed, that Dr.
Rush was called to his first patient on the 5th of August;
but Mr. Carey mentions a child of Dr. Hodges “as
probably the first victim;” who was taken ill on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
26th or 27th of July. This same month the unfortunate
fugitives had arrived from Cape Francois; and we
have already seen, from Dr. Clarke, that the arrival of
some of their fellow-sufferers in Dominica had the same
dreadful attendant. Whether the disorder is to be
ascribed to the arrival of these people in either place, the
reader will judge. Other vessels are charged with having
imported the same; but, facts being disputed, we cannot
enter into the controversy.</p>

<p>The disease began in Water-street, to a particular
part of which, near to that where the suspected ships lay,
it was for some time confined, but did not excite public
alarm till about the 19th of August. From this time to
the 25th of the month the attention of the citizens was
so much aroused, that they began to move into the country;
and on the 22d, the city commissioners were peremptorily
ordered by the mayor to keep the city clean.
On the 26th the College met, and addressed the citizens
on the subject; recommending such means of preventing
the spreading of the sickness as to them seemed most
proper. Among these were, to avoid any intercourse
with the infected, to live temperate, keep their minds
easy, and to avoid fatigue. Lighting of fires was particularly
disapproved of; but the burning of gunpowder,
and the steams of vinegar and camphor, were
recommended for infected rooms, and for using on handkerchiefs,
and in smelling-bottles.</p>

<p>In consequence of this address also the bells were stopped
from tolling, the constant noise of which had greatly
contributed to increase the public alarm. The people,
who had been in use to light large fires in the corners of
the streets, being forbid on the 29th by proclamation to
do so, had recourse to firing of guns; which was at last
carried to such excess, that it also was prohibited by
proclamation on the 4th of September.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions, the distemper
continued to increase in such a manner as to produce the
most dreadful terror and dismay. “Indeed (says Mr.
Carey) it is not probable that London, at the last stage
of the plague, exhibited stronger marks of terror than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
were to be seen in Philadelphia, from the 26th or 27th
of August, till pretty late in September.” This produced
scenes of distress unparalleled till this time in the
city, and of which many instances are to be met with
in Mr. Carey’s account. It cannot, however, be doubted
that the violence of the distemper, its contagious nature,
and the consequent danger of visiting the metropolis,
were greatly exaggerated. Thus terror was struck
throughout all the adjacent states. At Chester-town,
in Maryland, a meeting was held, on the 10th of September,
in consequence of which the Eastern shore line of
stages was quickly stopped. On the 10th of the same
month it was ordered by the mayor of New York that
the names of all such persons as had arrived or should
arrive from Philadelphia or other place, by land or water,
that were or <i>should be sick</i>, should be reported to him,
that those who were sick of infectious diseases might be
removed out of the city. Next day the governor proclaimed
that all vessels from Philadelphia should approach
no nearer than Bedlow’s island, about two miles
from the town, till license was given. But these precautions
not being deemed sufficient, a night watch was established,
and next day an address was published by delegates,
purporting the insufficiency of all that had been
done, and again calling upon their fellow-citizens to exert
their utmost vigilance in detecting the fugitives from Philadelphia.
Various other resolutions were passed in New
York; and throughout the whole continent such measures
were taken as seemed most likely to proscribe the
unhappy Philadelphians, and to prevent their having
any place of refuge from the sickness they so much dreaded.
On the 1st of October, however, the inhabitants
of Springfield, in New Jersey, passed a resolve, offering
their town as an asylum for the people of Philadelphia,
and directing an hospital to be provided for the reception
of such as might fall sick. Similar resolutions were
passed by the inhabitants of Elizabethtown, and Elkton
in Maryland.</p>

<p>The distemper in the mean time arrived at the most
dreadful height in Philadelphia, and almost all those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
who could take the charge and burthen of public affairs
were absent. An hospital had been established at
Bush Hill, but, for want of superintendence, had fallen
into such disorder, that the poor chose rather to deny
their illness than to be sent to it. On the 15th of September,
however, Stephen Girard, a native of France,
and a wealthy merchant, together with Peter Helm, a
native of Pennsylvania, offered their services as superintendants.
By their exertions the credit of the hospital
was soon retrieved, and such numbers demanded admittance,
that it became necessary for each candidate to procure
a certificate from a physician, that the patient really
laboured under a malignant fever. In a short time the affairs
of the city went on, in every respect, with as much
regularity as could be expected; but the mortality increased
throughout the month of September, and the three first
weeks of October. Great hopes were entertained from
some cold and rainy weather in the end September; but
they proved illusive, and the disease became even more
fatal than before, till the 26th of October, when it suddenly
ceased, as Mr. Carey says, with hardly any rain,
and a very moderate degree of cold. “That day (adds
he) was as warm as many of the most fatal ones in the
early part of the month. To account for this is perhaps
above our power. In fact, the whole of the disorder,
from its first appearance to its final close, has set
human wisdom and calculation at defiance.” During
the time of this calamity Mr. Carey computes that <i>seventeen</i>
thousand left the city, and <i>four</i> thousand and thirty-one
perished.</p>

<p>This city suffered another attack in 1794 but far less
severe than before. In 1795 and 1796 the disease seems
scarcely to have made its appearance; but in 1797 it revived,
and, in 1798, broke out with greater fury than even in
1793. No particular history hath been published of
this last severe attack. We know only in general, that,
though a much greater number of the inhabitants fled
out of town in 1798 than in 1793, the number of deaths
was almost as great; being estimated at three thousand
eight hundred and forty-one. Great disputes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
as has been observed, have taken place concerning the
origin of these diseases; on which we shall only further
remark, that if, after such repeated and dreadful experience
of the bad effects of allowing putrid matters to accumulate,
such quantities could be collected as to produce
the very fatal sickness of last year, it argues a most
unaccountable, and indeed incredible, insensibility on the
part of the people, as well as remissness on that of the
magistrates; and this perhaps may be accounted as
strong an argument in favour of contagion as can be
adduced.</p>

<p>That such a violent distemper should cease all at once,
is indeed not to be expected; and we have already
heard of its again appearing in the city. Fear has been
very justly excited, there and in other places; but it is
to be hoped that the remarkable coolness of the season
will operate favourably in preventing any very violent
attack for this year.</p>

<p>New York has also suffered very considerably from
this disease. Here it appeared in 1791, in the autumn,
and in a part of the town remarkable for its vicinity to a
collection of filth. In 1792 it made no progress; and
in 1793, though some died of it who fled from Philadelphia,
it did not spread. In 1794 it returned with considerable
violence, and with still greater in 1795. In
the history of this disease by Dr. Seaman<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span> he takes notice
that in July and August an unusual number of persons
suffered from drinking cold water, and some fell
down and died in the streets; but the Doctor supposes
this to have happened rather through the excessive heat
of the sun than the drinking of water. As the disease
came on, all others gave way to it, even “<i>the common remitting
bilious fever</i>;<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> and in the month of July some
cases occurred. We have already had occasion to take
notice of the death of Dr. Treat, who was taken ill on the
22d of July; but before that time, on the 6th of the
same month, Dr. Seaman says that, in conjunction with
this gentleman, he had visited a patient “affected with
all the full-marked and decided symptoms of an highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
malignant yellow fever.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> The disease continued to
gain ground in August, and became extremely violent
in that and the following month; but, according to our
author, the low ground in the southeast part of the city
was the “grand centre of the calamity, diffusing its
effects like diverging rays, aiding, by its most powerful
influence, different secondary centres, already smoking
hot, to flame out its pestiferous <i>operations</i>.” In
this part of the town five hundred died in three months.</p>

<p>The attack at this time did not arouse the people to
a proper sense of their danger. As formerly, the origin
of the disease in 1795 had been attributed to the filth of
the city. Next year it was attributed to the same, and so
in 1797 and 1798. This last year, particularly, it is said
to have originated partly from great quantities of putrid
beef and fish, collected for exportation, and which could
not be exported. In Mr. Hardy’s account of this fever,
it is calculated that there died in 1798 two thousand
and eighty-six; but that, if it were taken into the account
how many left the town and died in the country,
the number would amount to between two thousand
four hundred, and two thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>It is not in Philadelphia and New York alone that
this distemper has prevailed. Boston, Newburyport,
Portsmouth, Portland, and even detached spots in the
country, to which it is not possible to trace any infection,
have felt its ravages. At Salem also, where the
disease was never known before, twenty-one cases, including
some doubtful ones, appeared in 1798; and of
these, eleven proved fatal. In 1796, when it prevailed
in Newburyport, it was supposed to have been introduced
by a vessel from the West Indies; and, according
to Dr. Coffin, the opinion would have been
incontrovertible, had not a large quantity of fish-garbage
been collected at the place where the vessel
landed; so that, though the disease spread from that
place, it could not be known whether it proceeded from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
the vessel, or the fish, or both. It seems now unfortunately
to be the case, that where this disease once gets footing
it cannot easily be eradicated. If we suppose it always
to be imported, the continual intercourse with the West
India islands will account for this; but the extreme difficulty,
or rather impossibility, of procuring an account
of facts or even a single fact which cannot be controverted,
renders every thing that can be said upon the
subject uncertain and precarious. In the case of New
London particularly, where 81 persons were destroyed
by it last year, neither importation nor collections
of filth could be assigned as the cause; nevertheless it
began near a <i>wharf</i>; but Mr. Holt, in his account of
the disease, thinks it was most probably owing to the
mere heat and dryness of the season. On the other
side of the question, however, we must still insert Dr.
Brackett’s account of the origin of the disease at Portsmouth,
in answer to a letter from Dr. Oliver of this
place.</p>

<p>“The yellow or pestilential fever made its first appearance
at Portsmouth, about the first of August last.
Eight or ten days before that time a vessel arrived here
from Martinico, and brought a French family (four
or five in number.) This vessel, before she left the
West Indies, had two sailors taken sick (as the captain
informed me) one of whom died on the passage
home; the other was on the recovery when the vessel
came into this port.</p>

<p>“There was not, nor had not been for a long time
before, any fever in this town. Two or three days
after, I heard that one or two men, who were labourers
(and probably had been on board, as they lived nigh
where the vessel lay at the wharf) died suddenly with
fever, but am uncertain whether with yellow fever, as
I never saw them. The first of August, the owner,
whose house was about four or five rods distant from
the vessel, had a child of four or five years of age taken
sick; the next day I visited it, and two days after
he died. The symptoms appeared like a cholera
morbus&mdash;sick stomach, and frequent puking of black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
bile. The day before he died a brother of his, fifteen
years old, was taken ill, and had much the same symptoms,
only greater inflammation and distress. He was
blooded freely, took calomel, bark, &amp;c. He died
five days after sickened. Between the 8th and the
20th of August, four or five of the other children and
servants were taken with the same symptoms, and recovered.
On the sixteenth day, a daughter, seventeen
years of age, was taken down with the same disease:
she was treated in the same manner, with bleeding,
mercury, warm bath, bark, &amp;c. and died on the 9th
day. This patient had a great discharge of blood
from her mouth and gums for three days before she
died. One or two more of the family had it afterwards,
and recovered. All these patients took the infection,
I believe, about the same time. Many others
in that neighbourhood had the fever during this
time, about one half of whom died: out of forty-six
patients I lost fifteen. If I could procure a soreness of
the fauces, by administering calomel in small doses,
and rubbing it in the gums, or by frictions on the legs
and arms with mercurial ointment, the third or fourth
day, I was sure of their recovery.</p>

<p>“How many died of this disease in the whole, I have
forgotten; as, through fatigue, and debility of body
and mind, I kept no notes: I think rather more than
half of those who had it. The fever agreed in every
symptom, almost, with that described by Dr. Rush and
others. The contagion did not appear to be propagated,
as the largest number who had the disease were
seized in the month of August, and lived in the streets
only which communicated with the wharf where the
vessel lay, and the beach where she was graved. These
streets are in the highest part of the town, and always
esteemed the most healthy, and as free of putrid substances
as any in it. In the months of September and
October the fever was followed by dysentery, and
spread through almost every part of the town and its
environs. There has been no case of fever or dysentery
since last fall: this place, during the winter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
summer thus far, has been uncommonly healthy; and
it appears likely to continue so, if the committee of
health should not be remiss in their duty. Thus,
without any comments, I have endeavoured to give
you a short history of the pestilential fever, as it appeared
here last summer. The ideas, you may communicate
to the author of the book intended to be
published.”</p>

<p>The following letter from Dr. Warren, which he
obligingly sent to two physicians in Salem, gives an accurate
account of the distemper which prevailed in Boston
last year:</p>

<p>“I should immediately have answered your favour of
last month, but for a wish to give you as complete an
account of the causes and mortality of the late epidemic
as could be collected.</p>

<p>“There were a number of suspected causes, which,
though concealed during the prevalence of the disease,
it was hoped would be developed after the agitation of
the public mind had entirely subsided; and I was in expectation
that some regular returns would have been
made of the numbers who had passed through the disease,
and of those who had died with it, so that some
estimate might be formed of its malignity and mortality;
but such returns have not yet been made, and it
is therefore impossible to obtain any satisfactory evidence
on those heads. I suppose the number of
deaths to have been rather short of two hundred;
but this is only a rude guess, and should not be
relied on in forming any consequential deductions
on the subject. I shall, however, now offer such an
account of the disorder as my present materials have
enabled me to prepare.</p>

<p>“The first unequivocal appearance of the malignant
fever, in the town of Boston, was on the 20th of July
1798 (though one family had been attacked with a
fever, attended with unusual symptoms, as early as the
middle of June; but, as no other instances occurred
for so long a time, of an alarming nature, some doubts
may perhaps be justly entertained of the identity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
affection.) Three or four cases only, I believe, happened
between this and the latter end of the month.
The two first of these were young men employed in
stores directly opposite to each other, on Green’s
wharf, near the Town-dock. A few days after, three
or four persons were seized with the same complaint,
whilst following their respective occupation in Market
square, on the east and south sides of Faneuil Hall,
or the Market-house. In the beginning of the
month of August several persons were taken sick in
the same neighbourhood, chiefly young men between
16 and 24 years of age, whilst employed in stores and
counting houses there situated. The stores in Merchant’s
row, extending from the Market to State-street
were more especially visited with the disease,
and, in the course of the same month, a family at the
bottom of State-street, and several persons at Oliver’s
dock, were taken sick. At this place a kind of bason
is formed between a point of the town projecting from
Fort hill, and the Long wharf, which is constantly receiving
the offals of fish, and other animal substances,
which from its situation could not be washed off by
the waters contained in it. This spot is remarkable
for having been the residence of most of the persons
first attacked with the bilious remittent fever of 1796.
To the latter end of this month the number of sick
continued to be increasing; but the attacks were principally
confined to the above-mentioned quarters, till
at length the disease appeared on the south side of
Fort hill, at some distance to the southward of Oliver’s
dock, leaping, as it were, over the summit of the
hill, without lighting upon the inhabitants on the
north of that eminence. The fatality of the disease
was here probably greater than in any part of the town
of equal population; and it was nearly the last place
in which it disappeared. Very few families who remained
in their own houses upon the hill escaped its
attack; and the progress of the disease, in all the places
above mentioned, seemed to have been arrested
only by means of the evacuation of the buildings by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
the people who inhabited them. In the latter end of
August, and through the month of September, many
persons were taken sick in Fore-street, which runs
northerly from Market of Dock square, along the
heads of the wharves, on the eastern side of the town.</p>

<p>“Through the whole period of the sickness scarcely a
person was taken ill who had not resided, or been in
daily employment, in the vicinity of these places. The
subjects of the disease were generally natives of the town,
chiefly in the prime of life, and in the vigour of health.
I recollect no instance of any French inhabitants being
assailed by it, and have heard of only one or two
instances of the blacks being affected with it.</p>

<p>“That the fever was in a degree contagious, I cannot
entertain a doubt; but that it was not so in a very
high degree, I am as fully persuaded, from the number
of cases in which there was reason to believe it could
not have been taken in that way. In most instances,
where contagion might have been suspected,
the subjects were so situated that they might have received
it from the same source as those with whom they
had communicated. I cannot learn that any evidence
has been furnished of infection from the sick who had
been removed into the country, though there were
many instances of such removals, under the most malignant
forms which it assumed.</p>

<p>“The fever was generally ushered in by a chill, but I
think by no means equal to that which commonly
precedes fevers of the ardent kind, nor in proportion
to the violence of its subsequent periods. In a short
time the rigors were succeeded by excessive heat; the
pulse, which had been small and contracted, became
hard and full; the respiration laborious from violent
oppression at the scrobiculus cordis; the tongue assumed
a whitish cast; the eyes became highly inflamed,
while the pains in the head, back, and legs, were
intolerably severe. To these symptoms succeeded
nausea, and vomiting sometimes of a highly bilious
matter, seldom attended with diarrhœa, but often
with a burning at the stomach, tenderness of the abdomen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
parcity of urine; and, in one instance, a dysuria,
with a great proportion of blood at each evacuation
of that fluid.</p>

<p>“These appearances usually continued about 48
hours, after which they often suddenly gave place to a
very different train of symptoms. The pulse sunk
astonishingly, and became intermittent; the heat and
pains entirely subsided; and the patient supposed
himself to be out of danger. From a perfect possession
of all his intellectual faculties, with a serenity of mind,
which in no other disease, I believe, is so generally observed
to accompany its last stages, on or about the 5th
day from the accession of the fever, he fell into a state
of insensibility, and thence sunk gently into the arms
of death. In others this change was less rapid; the
pulse became gradually smaller, the distressing symptoms
slowly abated, a coldness of the extremities took
place, and continued for several days before death, accompanied
with clammy sweats, often without any
perceptible pulse in the wrists, for several hours before
the fatal termination. The tongue seldom became
much coated, to the last. Delirium was by no means
generally attendant; and a yellowness of the skin was
far from being universal; sometimes, however, this
appearance was observed within the three first days;
often on the fourth and fifth; and I was induced to
consider it as an accident, rather than a constituent
character of the disease.</p>

<p>“The black vomit, as it has been usually called,
though in my opinion by no means to be considered as
a pathognomic sign of the disease (as I have frequently
seen it take place in other acute fevers, especially the
puerperal) was very frequently attendant on the last stages
of the disorder; very few recovered after this circumstance
had taken place; in one person, however, who
had it in the most alarming form, together with an intermittent
pulse, coldness of the extremities, singultus,
and every usual mark of immediate dissolution, a most
unexpected recovery happily disappointed the positive
prognostics of his physicians. As the cure advanced, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
skin in this instance became extremely yellow, and continued
so for many weeks after the fever had subsided;
the biliary ducts having been completely obstructed, and
consequently the alvine evacuations of a clayey colour,
and with much difficulty procured. Frequent repetitions
of rhubarb and calomel in large doses, the continuance
of the mercurial medicine in small doses, so as
to keep up a continual ptyalism, and a laxative diet,
restored him to perfect health.</p>

<p>“For the discoveries which were made on dissecting
the bodies of some of those who died with the disease,
I beg leave to refer you to a publication in the Boston
Centinel, made during the prevalence of the disorder
in this place, and subscribed by Dr. Isaac Rand, sen.
President of the M. Medical Society, and myself.”
(For these discoveries see the <a href="#Characters_and_most_remarkable_Symptoms">table</a>, facing p.&nbsp;434.)</p>

<p>“We had heretofore treated our patients agreeably
to the method practised at Philadelphia in 1793, with
bleeding in most instances, and active purges of jalap
and calomel, or Rochelle salts. The diseased state of
the liver, the known effects of mercury in hepatitis,
and the recollection of the suggestions contained in
Dr. Rush’s publication on the yellow fever, together
with those of several other celebrated writers on the
same subject, induced us to enter immediately on the
use of calomel in small doses, as recommended in our
paper above referred to.</p>

<p>“In my own practice I <i>now</i> usually commenced the
treatment by bleeding from ten to sixteen ounces, and
followed it by a dose of between ten and fifteen grains
of calomel with between twenty and twenty-five
grains of jalap, or an ounce of Rochelle salts, or more,
according to the constitution. Immediately after the
operation of these medicines I began with the use of
calomel in small doses, in pills of a grain, every hour,
and sometimes of 3 grains every two hours. Within
the first twenty-four hours, but scarcely ever after, I
found occasion frequently to repeat the bleeding, and
it is worthy of remark, that in scarcely a single instance
was this operation performed without almost instantaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
relief; although in most cases, a few hours after,
there was a recurrence of the symptoms. The
blood for the most part was dark. In three cases there
was no separation of serum from the coagulated mass
at the end of forty-eight hours. In two of these (and
they were the only cases in which I observed it) a firm
buff was formed on its surface; and all three died of
the disease.</p>

<p>“The calomel was often continued through the whole
course of the fever; and ptyalism was usually brought
on within three or four days: though sometimes upwards
of 200 grains were given, at the rate of a grain
every hour, without any specific effect on the salivary
glands. In proportion as the soreness of the mouth advanced,
the symptoms universally gave way; and in
every patient, two only excepted, this effect of the remedy
was a sure pledge of recovery. In this exception
were comprehended two persons of the same family, a
father and daughter, both of whom had survived the
14th day of the disease, had copious hæmorrhages from
the mouth (a circumstance which also attended on many
who recovered) and died in a state of apparent putrefaction.</p>

<p>“The purgative medicines were generally repeated
every second day; or an enema of water gruel was administered
occasionally, if the bowels were constipated;
but if otherwise, and the calomel passed off by
those emunctories, opium was combined with it in
sufficient quantities to restrain the discharge. The
evacuations which took place from the intestines, during
the use of the mercury, were almost universally of
a remarkably dark colour, generally approaching to a
deep green, but by no means remarkably fœtid.
When spontaneous, they were often observed to be of
the colour and consistence of water gruel.</p>

<p>“In cases of very laborious respiration, which was frequently
in an extreme degree distressing, especially after
the first 36 or 48 hours had elapsed, blisters, applied
either to the chest or extremities, had a favourable
effect; on the latter, they were most useful in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
advanced stages of the disease, by exciting to action
the debilitated vessels, and by restoring circulation and
warmth to the parts. In the same intention, wine,
snake-root, and the bark, were sometimes used with
advantage.</p>

<p>“The diet was generally of the lightest and most cooling
nature; barley-water, apple-water, and spruce-beer,
were generally both grateful and salutary. The
warm bath was often exhibited with apparent success,
especially in the beginning of the disease, and when a
copious sweat had been induced by it. The cold bath
was also resorted to by some respectable practitioners,
and perhaps, under some circumstances, with good effects;
but I have no reason to think it was generally
advantageous.</p>

<p>“Upon the whole, I believe that the most efficacious
remedy, and the only one to be relied on, is mercury.
It is certain that, as far as my observation has extended,
under no other method of treatment did so many
recover; and there were but few instances of a fatal
termination, when it had been administered from the
commencement of the fever.</p>

<p>“Various have been the causes assigned to this disease.
That its origin was domestic, I have not a single doubt.
No instance of the arrival of any vessel from the warmer
latitudes, with this sickness on board, has been discovered;
and it is believed that the local causes are
sufficiently numerous to account for its existence. At
most of the places, where its ravages have been made,
very large quantities of putrid substances had been for
some time accumulating. The offals from the fish
market, as well as damaged fresh and salted fish to an
immense amount, had been thrown into the dock. A
very great number of raw hides had been imported,
and stored in places contiguous to those in which business
was constantly going on. The influence of a
continued heat through the summer, to a degree scarcely
before known in this country, had rendered these
articles highly putrid; and from the same cause several
articles of provision, such as barrelled beef, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
which had been prepared for exportation, but, by reason
of the restraints laid on our commerce, retained in
store, had become tainted. The effects of these were
in some instances incontestibly evinced; three lads,
who had been employed in repacking beef, were at
about the same time seized with the disease in its most
fatal form; and a person, who had purchased some of
the hides at a low price, immediately after their removal
fell a sacrifice to his folly.</p>

<p>“Two or three thousand of the inhabitants removed
into the country, and began to return about the middle
of October, when the decline of the disease justified
the measure.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span></p>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Methods of Prevention and Cure.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap">I<span class="ls01em">N</span> the yellow fever, as in the plague, where an attack
is frequently made with such violence as to bring on
death in twenty-four hours, or even a still shorter time,
it is plain that much more dependence must be placed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
prevention than the efforts of the most skilful physician
after the disease has once begun; for, in such violent attacks,
medicines, though ever so powerful, have not time
to act. In countries therefore where this terrible disease
exists, the first consideration necessary for every individual
is, whether he is one of those likely to be attacked by it.
Now, from the general testimony of those who have seen
this fever, it appears that such as are newly arrived, the
young, and in other respects the healthy and strong, the
laborious, and the intemperate, are most liable to be attacked.
Dr. Nassy of Philadelphia seems <i>alone</i> to afford
an exception to the general testimony. Speaking of the
cause of epidemics, after having ascribed them to some
constitution of the atmosphere, he says, “If the air is
not infected, diseases cannot be epidemic; and this is
so, <i>indeed</i>, though it only attacks the natives. What
can be the cause of that corruption of the air? For
what reason are the natives, and those inured to the
climate of Philadelphia, <i>alone</i> infected with the prevailing
disease, while <i>foreigners</i> escape it?” Dr. Chisholm
particularly points out those who, in 1793, were
most liable to the Boullam fever. These were, “1. Sailors;
more especially the robust and young; those
least accustomed to the climate; and those most given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
to drink new rum. 2. Soldiers; more especially
recruits from Europe; and the most intemperate.
3. White males in general lately arrived; more especially
young men from Europe. 4. All other white males;
more especially the lower classes; and of them the
most intemperate; those debilitated by recent sickness.
5. White, females, more especially those connected
with the shipping; and those lately from Europe.
6. People of colour, from <i>Mustees</i> to <i>Cabres</i>. 7. Negro
men; more especially sailors and porters. 8. Negro
women; more especially house wenches. 9. Children;
more especially those of colour.” It is certain,
however, that, when the distemper rages with great
violence, natives as well as foreigners are liable to be attacked.
We cannot suppose that all who perished at
Philadelphia in 1793 and 1798 were foreigners. Though
the latter therefore have the greatest occasion to fear,
the natives must not think themselves absolutely secure;
neither are foreigners to be terrified in such a manner as
if they could not escape. With respect to the general
modes of prevention, then, to which it is the business of
every individual to attend, the following things are to be
taken into consideration:</p>

<p>1. Every one who comes from a cold to a warm climate
may be assured that on his arrival the temperature
of his body is higher by three or four degrees than that
of the native inhabitants.</p>

<p>2. In this situation he must consider himself as necessarily
about to undergo a change of constitution; and
such change he may likewise be assured will best be made
by the gradual operations of nature; concerning which
we know so little, that it does not seem adviseable to use
any artificial method of promoting or accelerating it.</p>

<p>3. As the voyage from the Eastern continent must
have taken up a considerable time, and as the mode of
living on sea must have been very different from that to
which he was formerly accustomed, we must consider the
constitution as already in some degree altered from what
it was when the person first went on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span></p>

<p>4. This alteration will be greater or less according to
circumstances. If the vessel has been much crowded
with passengers; if the weather has been stormy, so that
he has been exposed to damp; if they have had little
water, or of bad quality; if their provisions have been
bad, or if there has not been a sufficient supply of fresh
air in the place where he slept; the body must be considered
as already predisposed to disease, which the new
climate will scarcely fail of bringing to maturity.</p>

<p>5. Every one must consider that mode of living to
which he has been accustomed the greatest part of his
life as <i>natural</i> to him. Any considerable deviation from
it, especially if sudden, would be of bad consequence,
even in his own country; much more must it be so in
another. As much as possible therefore he ought to
conform his mode of life in the new country to what it
was in the old, adhering only to the rules of temperance.</p>

<p>6. It has already been observed, that we must take into
account the time that the person has been at sea, and
the difference between his mode of life during his voyage,
and that to which he was formerly accustomed. This
difference consists in one particular in having lived for
some weeks entirely upon salt provisions. To these he
has been in some measure accustomed; and therefore it
must be reckoned injudicious to give up the use of salted
meat at once for such as is fresh. In fact, this mode
of abandoning salt meat for fresh has been reckoned by
the best physicians one of the causes by which the disease
is brought on. Drs. Taylor and Hansforth express
themselves in the following manner on this subject: “It
has been noticed by several medical writers, that fresh
meats, and particularly beef, in southern climates, apparently
generate fluxes and other malignant diseases.”
Dr. Ramsay, also, says of those who were mostly affected
with the yellow fever in Norfolk, that, “being <i>foreigners</i>,
they dealt lavishly in beef, fish, and all kinds of
fresh food. Observe, this beef was driven perhaps from
one to two hundred miles before killed, then exposed in
a hot market to vend; that, by one o’clock, their dining
hour, I always did, and do, believe it must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
been tainted. Observe, the fish were all dead by break
of day, and brought by land from twenty to twelve
miles&mdash;hard drinkers of spirits mostly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
One or two natural born citizens were the whole, out
of upwards of two hundred and twenty, who, in the
space of six weeks, fell victims to this disease. The
natives live chiefly on salted meats and fowls, or other
kinds of poultry, which are killed but a little time
before dressing.” It is unfortunate that among the
emigrants from cold countries there is a general prejudice
against salt, as highly inflammatory; and many diseases
are imputed to the use of it where it is undoubtedly
entirely innocent. In very cold climates indeed it
has with great reason been supposed to produce the
scurvy; and the Tchutski, who conducted capt. Billings
through their frozen regions, informed him that
salt was poison in their climate; throwing away, with
marks of abhorrence, a quantity he had brought with
him from his frigate. We cannot indeed argue from
salt being pernicious in a cold climate that it is medicinal
in a warm one, but we shall soon see that it has
been recommended in the plague, and may not improbably
be useful in the yellow fever. At any rate the
practice of the natives ought in this respect to be a rule for
emigrants, rather than any theories they may have laid
down previous to their leaving their own country.</p>

<p>7. In like manner those who newly arrive in a warm
climate ought to avoid as much as possible the using of
violent exercise in a heat greater than that to which
they have been accustomed, and by all means to avoid
intemperance in spiritous liquors. We are not however
to imagine from this that such as have been accustomed
to drink spiritous liquors are all at once to give
over the use of them, and live a life of abstinence. On
this subject Mr. Hardie, in his account of the malignant
fever of 1795, has the following judicious observation:
“It has often been said, that temperance was the best
preservative against infection. The observation, in
general, is certainly just; but it may, and during the
late calamity has, been carried too far. For my part,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
from what has come under my own knowledge, I have
no hesitation in asserting, that to persons who had
been accustomed to live freely, nothing could be more
dangerous than to become remarkably abstemious
upon the appearance of this disorder. Persons of the
above description should, in my opinion, have continued
to live in their usual manner; by which means
they would have been more likely to repel infection,
or if infected, they would have more strength to
resist the attack. But, whilst I consider abstinence in
such a situation as highly improper, a state of intemperance
is certainly more so; for, were it necessary, I
could mention the names of several individuals, who
whilst in a state of intoxication were attacked with the
fever, and in two days after were tenants of the grave.
The fate of such people might be pronounced almost
with certainty: they were seized with symptoms of a
peculiarly malignant nature, and their death seemed
unavoidable.”</p>

<p>On the subject of vegetables much declamation has
been used. If we give heed to some, it might almost be
supposed that all diseases incident to human nature are
owing to the use of animal food. The following paragraphs
from Webster’s Collection may serve as a specimen:
“We shall not repeat the observations which we
have heretofore made, upon the averseness the Americans
feel for soup and restorative broths, on their eating
their meat running with blood, with scarcely any bread,
and plenty of heavy potatoes, the only vegetables which
are seen on their tables; whilst the French always give
the preference to vegetables, and especially to those
which are light and wholesome. But we cannot help
observing, that, in the months of May, June and July,
the streets and markets were seen in the morning furnished
with an immense quantity of fruits, the most
part of which are either green or unripe. In the evening
all those fruits have disappeared and have been
eaten; hence bloody fluxes, dysenteries and bad
chyles, which unwholsome food must undoubtedly
produce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span></p>

<p>“The city of Naples contains about four hundred
thousand inhabitants; of whom thirty or forty thousand
are said to belong to the class of beggars. In that
climate the rains prevail, with little intermission, for
three months, from February to May. From May to
September, a drought, equally severe, and scarcely allayed
in many years by a single plentiful rain, renders
the heat almost intolerable. The wages of a labourer
not exceeding eight pence this currency a day, and
meat being rarely had in their markets for less than
four pence the pound, and vinous liquors in the same
proportion, the mass of population is excluded from
any share of these luxuries; of consequence they support
themselves on vegetables, roots, sallads, fruits, &amp;c.
and dilute their food, and animate their spirits, with
water and lemonade. Yet this city has, for a great
number of years, known no general disease. And for
ten years no febrile disease, of any sort, was common
among them. They also pay great attention to personal
cleanliness. Facts of this sort are very important,
and form the best comment on the discordant opinions
of our physicians.”</p>

<p>As a contrast to these the reader may take the following
quotation from the Medical Extracts:</p>

<p>“One gentleman excepted, says Dr. Shebbeare, and I
never saw a gentleman or lady who wholly abstained
from animal food look like other people; nothing is
so easy to distinguish as a <i>vegetable man</i> by his physiognomy,
the fittest appellation by which they can be
distinguished; he neither moves, talks nor looks like
other people; his face conveys a declaration of his
whole body being out of order, by the lifeless insipidity
which is in it, as his conversation does of his mind
being disturbed, his whole time being taken up in
recounting to the world his manner of living, his feelings,
his weak stomach, his disturbed sleep, &amp;c.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If he pretends to have spirits, it is no more than a certain
equability of a lifeless, inanimate state, like that
of the dormouse among animals, or the yew tree in
winter among vegetables,” &amp;c. (Medical Extracts,
vol.&nbsp;x. p.&nbsp;234.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span></p>

<p>On the subject of vegetable and animal food we find
the following observations in Willich’s Lectures on diet,
&amp;c. “In the primitive ages, people subsisted chiefly on
plants and fruits. Even to this day many nations, the
Bramins, for instance, abstain from the use of animal
food. The ancient Germans also, who were so renowned
for their bodily strength, lived upon acorns, wood-apples,
sour milk, and other productions of their then
uncultivated soil. In the present mode of life, here (in
England) as well as on the continent, a great proportion
of the poorer class of country people almost entirely
subsist on vegetables. Although these people
duly digest their vegetable aliment, and become vigorous,
yet it is certain that animal food would answer
these purposes much better. Hence, in countries
where the labouring class of people live principally upon
animal food, they far excel in strength and durability.”</p>

<p>On the subject of diet we shall take notice only of
one article more, and that is, the use of warm diluting
liquors. These are commonly three in number, viz.
tea, coffee and chocolate. Abundance of declamations
have been published against the use of these, particularly
the first; but the daily experience of multitudes
shows that its use, in moderation, is perfectly innocent.
Indeed when people go to excess with this, as well as any
thing else, bad effects must certainly ensue. <span class="nowrap">Zimmerman<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span>
mentions a Dutch physician (Bontikoe) who maintained
that tea <i>ought</i> to be drank in the quantity of <i>one</i>
or <i>two hundred</i> cups a day! But such ridiculous excesses
must make any thing destructive to health; and accordingly
this practice, being opposed by Boerhaave,
soon fell into disuse. Coffee has the same exhilarating
virtue as tea, but must be considerably different in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
qualities, as having in it a portion of empyreumatic oil
extracted by the toasting, and therefore a change from
tea to coffee in such as come into a warm country seems
to be improper. Chocolate differs considerably from
both, possessing no exhilarating virtue, or only in a small
degree, but is more nutritive, and in South America
constitutes a considerable part of the food. On coming
into warm climates it is obvious that the increased perspiration
must be supplied by a considerable quantity of
diluting liquids; and such of these as the person has
been most accustomed to ought to be preferred. For
the rest, diluted malt liquors seem preferable to spirits
and water. Cyder, though very agreeable when fresh,
is apt to become vapid, and even get a putrescent taint.
Perhaps a plain infusion of malt, of late found so useful
at sea, might also prove beneficial at land, where proper
fermented liquors cannot be had.</p>

<p>These modes of prevention are obviously derived
from the circumstances which attend every emigrant
from a cold to a warm country. The indication
must be, to keep themselves as cool as possible, without
debilitating the body. It was formerly a custom
to use bleeding and purging when people arrived in
warm latitudes; but this practice fell into disuse, perhaps
without sufficient reason. Dr. Rush attests the
efficacy of these remedies as preventives when signs
of the disease appeared. “During the existence of the
premonitory symptoms (says he) and before patients
were confined to their rooms, a gentle purge, or the
loss of a few ounces of blood, in many hundred instances
prevented the formation of the fever. I did
not meet with a single exception to this remark.” As
mercury is found to be one of the best remedies, if not
the only one, that can be depended upon for curing the
disease after it is once formed, it is natural to think that
it would act as a preventive; and accordingly we find,
in Dr. Walker’s account of the yellow fever in Jamaica,
an instance to our purpose. When the fort of Omoa
was taken from the Spaniards, a great quantity of
quicksilver was carried off by the English. One ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
was loaded with it, and, the vessels containing it being
broken by the shot of the ship which captured her, a
number of men were employed in collecting it with their
hands into buckets. Not one of these men was in the
least affected with sickness, though a most malignant
fever raged among the rest. Preventives of such a
powerful nature, however, could not well be adopted
without the advice of a physician; it being evidently
dangerous for any person unacquainted with medicine to
tamper with himself in this way.</p>

<p>When the disease happens to get into a town, it then
becomes an object for every person to avoid the danger;
and for this Dr. Chisholm has given such instructions as
seem to be quite sufficient for any individual, and may
be very easily reduced to practice. His observations
may be summed up as follows: 1. To avoid going into
infected houses. 2. If this cannot be done, to avoid
going into the chamber of the sick. 3. If neither of
these is practicable, to avoid a near approach to the sick
person. 4. To avoid drawing in his breath, or that
peculiar smell which issues from the bodies of the sick;
and not to touch the bed-clothes. By neglecting this the
person becomes affected with nausea: slight rigors and
head-ach succeed in a few hours by the disease. 5. Not
to touch the patient’s body or his wearing apparel, or
suffer the effluvia from either to be blown upon the body.
The distance at which the contagion acts is by Dr. Chisholm
supposed not to exceed ten feet; but Dr. Lind
thinks it may extend to fifty or sixty feet; but this
must depend very much upon circumstances. The only
thing that can be done in such cases is to keep at as
great a distance as possible. As to the preventives commonly
recommended, such as vinegar, camphor, garlic,
&amp;c. we have no accounts of their having ever been efficacious
in any case; and there is not the least reason to
think that they can be so.</p>

<p>To purify rooms or ships from the infection they have
received, it has formerly been observed that fumigations
with the acid of nitre have been recommended. According
to the theory of Dr. Mitchill of New York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
however, this mode of prevention must not only be useless
but pernicious. The reason is, that according to
this gentleman the disease is produced by the very acid
in question. His reasoning is shortly this: Putrid substances
evolve various sorts of air, two of which by combination
form the acid of nitre. Neither of these by
themselves are capable of producing fever, though in
conjunction they are. Their combination is the acid
of nitre, which the Doctor thinks is always that which
produces putrefaction. Dr. Girtanner has related an
experiment which seems to confirm this opinion, viz.
that, having injected some nitrous air into the jugular
vein of a dog, the animal died in a short time, and upon
opening him his lungs were found of a greenish colour
and partly putrid. Dr. Beddoes adds, in a note, that
the green colour is a sign of the existence of nitrous acid,
not of putridity; but, notwithstanding this, Dr. Girtanner
might still have been in the right, as we cannot
say that the existence of nitrous acid is incompatible
with putridity. But there is not any occasion to enter
into a discussion of the question, as the matter seems to
be determined by facts which cannot be overthrown.
Dr. Carmichael Smyth, in a treatise on the jail fever,
considers the disease as proceeding from putrefaction, and
“particularly the putrefaction of the <i>perspirable matter</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span>
when there is not a renewal of the application of air to
carry it off.” With regard to <i>specific</i> contagions he
thinks they can neither be carried off nor blunted, but
by exposure to the open air or to a stream of water;
but with <i>putrid</i> contagions he believes that they may be
destroyed by the mineral acids in a state of vapour. The
pernicious qualities of the fumes of sulphur prevented
him from making any trials with that substance; but
to nitre there was no such objection, and he therefore
proceeded in the following manner; the subjects of his
trial being the prison wards at Winchester, where the
Spanish prisoners were kept, and among whom a typhus
fever was making rapid progress: Having divided the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
wards into four parts, he removed the prisoners into three
of them, took out of the fourth division all the hammocks
and bedding, and had them thoroughly cleaned
out. The hammock posts were well washed with diluted
spirit of salt. The wards, when dry, were closely shut
up, and pots placed in them at different distances, containing
from half a pound to a pound of nitre, which
was deflagrated by an iron heater put into each pot<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span>
The wards were then shut up for some hours, and when
opened were exposed to a free ventilation. The process
was repeated twice or thrice, after which the prisoners
were likewise cleaned; their old clothes, bedding, &amp;c.
taken away, were replaced by others, and none of these
were afterwards seized with the fever.</p>

<p>A much more decisive experiment was afterwards
made at Sheerness on board the Union hospital ship,
where there were upwards of two hundred people sick of
a very malignant fever. Previous to the fumigation all
the ports and scuttles were shut up. “Sand which had
been heated in an iron pot was then scooped into
earthen pipkins, into each of which was put a small
tea-cup containing about half an ounce of vitriolic
acid; to which after it had acquired a proper degree
of heat an equal quantity of nitre in powder was
gradually added, and the mixture stirred with a glass
spatula, until vapour arose from it in considerable
quantity. The pipkins were then carried through
the wards by the nurses and convalescents who kept
walking about with them in their hands, occasionally
putting them under the cradles of the sick, and in
every corner where any foul air was suspected to lodge.
Thus the fumigation was continued, until the whole
space between decks, fore and aft, was filled with the
vapour, which appeared like a thick haze.”</p>

<p>The first fumigation was performed in about three
hours; the vapour subsided in about an hour, when the
ports and scuttles were thrown open for the admission of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
fresh air. Mr. Menzies, the operator, perceived that even
by this first fumigation the air was considerably sweetened;
and on repeating the operation next day, which (now
that the people were more expert) took up only an hour,
such a change was made as the nurses and attendants
were very sensible of, and, beginning to put confidence
in the remedy, approached the cradles of the sick with
less fear. The experiment was further carried on by
Mr. Bassan, to whom Mr. Menzies resigned the office of
conducting it; and from repeated trials it appeared that
the fumigation effectually counteracted the influence of
the contagion, though numbers of patients, labouring
under the most malignant fevers, were received from the
Russian ships of war.</p>

<p>The good effects of nitrous vapour used in this way is
also confirmed by Mr. David Paterson, now surgeon in
Montrose in Scotland. The trial took place in the prison
wards at Forton. The operation was performed in
the manner above related, and with such success, that a
ward 57 feet long, 10 feet and an half high, and 20 feet
broad, was filled in a quarter of an hour, only by
means of three pipkins. The good effects were extremely
obvious, and Mr. Paterson observed that in the wards
which had been fumigated at night there was an agreeable
smell next morning; and by this smell he was able
to discover whether the operation had been properly performed
or not. The same author gives several cases in
which the good effects of the pure acid vapour of nitre
in cleansing putrid ulcers was manifest. A third testimony
of the efficacy of this vapour is given in a letter
to Dr. Garthshore of London from Mr. James McGregor,
surgeon to the 88th regiment, in the island of Jersey.
The disease was a typhus fever, which had formerly
proved very destructive; but, while the acid vapour
was used, only one out of <i>sixty-six</i> cases proved fatal. Mr.
McGregor is not only of opinion that the nitrous fume
prevented the contagion from acting fatally, but that it
destroyed it altogether, so that no more cases appeared.
Mr. Paterson made trial of different acids, but had not
completed his experiments: we are informed, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
in the Medical Extracts, that in the year 1795, near
about the time that the last experiments were made upon
the Union hospital ship, Morveau in France had employed,
for the same purpose, oxygenated muriatic <span class="nowrap">acid<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span>
in the form of air or vapour, with which he purified
the infected hospital at Dijon; and the same method
was afterwards extended to the different military hospitals
by a decree of the National Assembly.</p>

<p>This mode of prevention seems to be established on
as sure a testimony as any thing can be; but what can
be said that will not be disputed? Dr. Trotter has
argued in the most strenuous manner that such fumigation
is not only useless, but pernicious. “The
whole preservative means (says he) are comprised in
the immediate removal of the sick; cleanliness in person
and in clothing; fires to keep the people warm in
the winter season; avoiding cold and moisture, fatigue
and intoxication; and keeping the ship dry and properly
ventilated.” To these he also thinks it would
be expedient to add a band of music in order to keep up
the spirits of the people; but, with regard to any thing
else, he thinks that “a physician of a fleet, though armed
with a diploma, and with the chemistry of the elements
at his fingers’ ends, will find that very little has
been left for him to do; whether his doctrine of prophylactics
(preventives) be the <i>vinegar of the four thieves</i>,
or the fumigations of modern physicians, under the
scientific appellations of sulphureous gas, muriatic acid
gas, or nitrous gas.” The Doctor was so zealous
against these noxious fumigations, that he wrote to Evan
Nepean, esq. at the Admiralty upon the subject. His
argument was, that every possible method was taken on
board of vessels to expel <i>azote</i> or <i>mephitic air</i>, by opening
ports, scuttles, &amp;c. and putting down windsails, &amp;c.
“This azote is the base of the nitrous acid: they only
differ in the degrees of combination with oxygen, or
what was formerly called dephlogisticated air: and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
proportion to the quantity it attracts of this principle
it is called azote, azotic gas, nitrous gas, nitrous acid,
nitric acid. In short, Dr. Smyth’s preventive is the
very substance that every intelligent officer is hourly
employed to drive from the decks of his Majesty’s
ships.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> This letter was transmitted to the commissioners
for the sick and wounded for their report. The answer
of the commissioners was to the full as learned as
the Doctor’s letter; but they considered the experiments
of Dr. Smyth and others as quite decisive upon the
subject, so that Dr. Trotter was obliged to submit. The
matter therefore being determined by such high authority,
we must take leave of the subject, and proceed to
consider the mode of preventing the disease from getting
entrance into any town, or of eradicating it when once
it has got in.</p>

<p>Among these the enacting and strictly enforcing quarantine
laws certainly hold the first place. But these
belonging entirely to the magistracy and police of the
place cannot be the subject of any discussion here. The
success of these has been so great in other countries, that
Dr. Willich informs us “that some of the most ingenious
practitioners of Italy and Germany are, at this
moment, employed in a serious attempt wholly to extirpate
this contagion (the small pox) from the continent
of Europe; an object which has formerly been
accomplished in the cases of the plague and leprosy.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span>
Perhaps, then, it is no improbable supposition, that, by
a strict observance of quarantine laws, and attention
to cleanliness, the yellow fever may be eradicated at least
from the northern states, whose climates are less congenial
to it than the southern.</p>

<p>Dr. Chisholm informs us that the general plan of prevention
made use of in Grenada consists in the destruction
of all small wooden buildings; obliging the inhabitants
to build with stone or brick; to make spacious
streets; to have the rooms of the houses as large as possible;
stables, necessaries, &amp;c. at a distance; and certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
places appointed as receptacles for filth, to which it must
be carried every morning; slaughter-houses at a distance
from the town, &amp;c. with a number of other particulars
relative to cleanliness which it is needless to enumerate
here; not forgetting the quarantines, lazarettos,
&amp;c. without which he does not think any activity
on the part of the people can avail.</p>

<p>Dr. Rush, who is an enemy to quarantines, recommends
to the people of Philadelphia the following particulars:
“1. Let the docks be immediately cleaned,
and let the accumulation of filth in them be prevented
in future, by conveying water into them by a passage
under the wharves, or by paving them with large
flag stones inclining in such a manner towards the
channel of the river as that the filth of the streets shall
descend from them (after it falls into the docks) into
the river. This method of paving docks has been
used with success in the city of Brest. 2. Let every
ship that belongs to our port be compelled by law to
carry a ventilator. Let all such ships as are discovered
to contain foul air in their holds be compelled to discharge
their cargoes before they reach our city, and
let the ships in port be compelled to pump out their
bilge water every day. 3. Let the common sewers be
washed frequently with streams of water from our
pumps. Perhaps an advantage would arise from
opening them, and removing such foul matters as
streams of water are unable to wash away. 4. Let
the gutters be washed every evening in warm weather.
By frequently washing the streets and pavements the
heat of the city would be lessened, and thereby one
of the predisposing causes of the fever would in some
measure be obviated. 5. The utmost care should be
taken to remove the filth from the yards and cellars of
every house in the city. Hog-sties should be forbidden
in yards, and the walls of cellars should be whitewashed
two or three times a year, and their floors
should be constantly covered with a thin layer of lime.
Whitewashing the outside of houses in sickly streets
would probably be useful. 6. Let the privies be emptied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
frequently; and let them be constructed in such
a manner as to prevent their contents from oozing
through the earth so as to contaminate the water of
the pumps. 7. Let all the filth be removed from the
neighbourhood of the city, and let the brick kiln and
other ponds be filled up from time to time with the
earth which is obtained in digging cellars. 8. In the
future improvements of our city, let there be no more
dwelling houses erected in alleys. They are often the
secret receptacles of every kind of filth. 9. The predisposition
of our citizens to be affected by the remote
and exciting causes of the yellow fever would be very
much lessened by their living sparingly upon fresh
animal food, and chiefly upon broths and fresh vegetables,
rendered savoury by spices and a small quantity
of salted meat, during the summer and autumnal
months. A constant attention should be paid at the
same time to bodily cleanliness.”</p>

<p>These are the modes of prevention which seem to be
the most obvious and necessary, as well as approved by
the best judges. It appears, however, that in certain
cases neither human skill nor care can prevent or cure
the disorder. The number of physicians who have fallen
victims to this disease are too manifest proofs of
this<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> Indeed, when we consider that it is the nature
of the distemper first of all to attack the vital parts, and
that this attack may commence with little or no pain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
it is evident that an attack may be begun before we
think of a preventive, and may, as it were in a moment,
prevail in such a manner as to be entirely beyond the
reach of medicine, before even a medicine is thought
necessary. In every case therefore, where the yellow fever
prevails, an attention to health becomes as necessary
as procuring the means of subsistence. Every precaution
must be used, and when we have done so we are
not even then secure. We are ignorant of the natural
causes which produce it; they are invisible to our
senses, and incomprehensible by our understandings.
Safety then can only be expected from the protection of
that Being to whom all natural causes are known, and
to whom all must yield obedience. In short, we may
sum up the whole in the well known sentence, “<i>He that
will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">TONGUE</span>
<i>from</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">EVIL</span>, <i>and his</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">LIPS</span> <i>that they speak no</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">GUILE</span>. <i>Let
him eschew</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">EVIL</span> <i>and do</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">GOOD</span>; <i>let him seek</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">PEACE</span>, <i>and
ensue it</i>.” A very strange receipt indeed, we will say;
but how often have we tried it?</p>

<p>The cure of the yellow fever hath been attempted in
various ways, according to the theories laid down by
different physicians concerning its nature. Dr. Cullen
considers it as of the nature of <i>typhus</i> fever<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span> and of consequence
would have treated it with antimonials; most
probably with his favourite remedy, tartar emetic. Dr.
Rush, from his opinion that it is the highest degree of
inflammatory fever, recommends powerful evacuants, and
large blood-letting, in 1793, and 1797, though he seems
to have altered his sentiments in 1798. Dr. Brown,
who would have considered it as a disease of debility,
would of course have prescribed opium and other
stimulants; and lastly, on the theory of Dr. Mitchill,
that the disease proceeds from an <i>acid</i>, remedies of
a nature directly opposite, viz. <i>alkalies</i>, ought to be
useful. It is not the design of this treatise to enter
into any consideration or comparison of the practice
of different physicians, but to point out at once, to
those who are not physicians, the remedies which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
been, by general consent, accounted most efficacious;
and in this respect there is now a surprising unanimity
among gentlemen of the medical profession. Those
which hold the first rank are,</p>

<p>1. <i>Mercury.</i> In the use of this medicine the physicians
of the Western world have certainly excelled those
of the East. In a paper in the Medical Repository, vol.
i, p.&nbsp;500, Dr. Holyoke of Salem says that the practice of
giving mercury was first introduced into New England
about 60 or 70 years ago<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> by a physician from Scotland,
a disciple of the celebrated Pitcairn. In 1734 or
1735 it was used successfully in a very malignant disease
called the <i>throat distemper</i>, and which he thinks was of
the same genus with the <i>malignant ulcerous sore throat</i>
treated of by Huxham. About 45 years ago it was commonly
used in pleurisies and other inflammatory disorders;
and, ever since the year 1751 or 1752, it has been
used by Dr. Holyoke himself. In Europe, however,
the case was exceedingly different; mercury being there
generally reckoned pernicious in such disorders, from a
notion of its being inflammatory, or dissolving the blood.
Thus, on the appearance of the Boullam fever in Grenada,
Dr. Chisholm found himself exceedingly at a loss
what to do, and he seems to have <i>invented</i>, rather than
to have been previously <i>instructed</i> in, the mercurial practice.
His success, however, was very great, provided he
could raise a salivation; but in order to do this he was
frequently obliged to give much larger doses than he had
ever done before, or had any notion of doing. In p.&nbsp;159
he mentions one patient who took 400 grains before
the salivary glands were affected. He tells us, however,
p. 271, that, on the re-appearance of the fever in 1794, he
gave the medicine in much larger doses than before; beginning
with mercury without any previous evacuations
which he had used the year before, and with such success
that he did not lose a single patient; so that he
professes himself almost ready to pronounce it <i>infallible</i>
in curing the disease. The practice of giving mercury
is confirmed by Dr. Rush, and indeed by so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
other physicians, that it is superfluous to quote them.
Dr. Nassy, formerly mentioned, again stands almost singular
in condemning the medicine, because it dissolves
the blood; but it is impossible that any theory, however
plausible, can stand against well attested facts. Dr. Rush
is indeed very much of opinion that it is easily practicable
for people to cure themselves of this disorder, dreadful
as it is, provided they take it in time. But by this we
must understand, that the very moment the person feels
uneasiness he must apply a remedy, and not trust to nature
in any case whatever. When the yellow fever prevails,
every one who feels the slightest disorder may be
assured that his disorder partakes of its nature, and ought
immediately to have recourse to a mercurial purge.
Dr. Rush says also that bleeding should be first performed.
The many disputes, however, concerning the efficacy
of this last remedy, must make any person hesitate
at the application of it without medical advice, especially
as a mercurial purge may be safely taken without it.</p>

<p>2. <i>Blood-letting.</i> This was, by Dr. Rush, considered
as the capital remedy in 1793; but Dr. Chisholm, who
made trial of it in the Boullam fever, found that it could
not be used with any degree of safety. Dr. Jackson
says it is frequently necessary in the Jamaica fever, but
it was seldom of use to repeat it. Dr. Walker says it
increased the debility in the same fever of 1793, 94 and
95. Dr. Moseley recommends it in the yellow fever of
the West Indies, but only in the first stage, and says that
the injudicious performance of this operation, when the
second stage has come on, has given occasion to the
opinion that a patient cannot bear two bleedings. Dr.
Coffin found it useful at Newburyport in 1796, in the
beginning of the disease, and says it may sometimes be
repeated. Repeated bleedings are recommended by Dr.
Ouviere of Philadelphia, who says they are not to be
omitted even in fat and weak habits. This is confirmed
by the editor of the Medical Repository, vol.&nbsp;i, p.&nbsp;92,
who says it was used with success at the hospital in New
York in 1796, “at repeated times, to the amount of
from 24 to 175 ounces, and in some cases several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
performed after the sixth day of the disease, to the
great relief of the sick.” Dr. Bruce recommends it in
the island of Barbadoes in the robust and plethoric<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span>
Dr. Hillary says that in the same island it is always absolutely
necessary, and that it may even be repeated once,
but that a third bleeding was seldom necessary. Dr,
Wright, in the same island, found the “lancet not only
unnecessary but dangerous in the extreme.” Dr. Clarke,
in Dominica, found it generally very pernicious, and assures
us “that there was not a single instance of an emigrant
recovering who had been bled in this disease. In
the first 24 hours indeed it was admissible in the young
and athletic seized a short time after their arrival, but
after that time, or at most after 36 hours, it will always
be found prejudicial, if not fatal.” It was not
tried by Dr. Bryce on board the Busbridge. It is recommended
by Dr. Currie in his treatise on bilious fevers.</p>

<p>It is needless to take up time with a detail of more
opinions. From those already recited it is natural to
conclude that the fever in some places, and at some
times, differs very much from others. This is conformable
to the opinion of Dr. Currie, who says, that the
bilious fever “is amazingly influenced in its aspect and
symptoms by the soil, situation, climate, season, and
by the preceding and present state of the atmosphere,
and the customary mode of living of the inhabitants.”
The utility or even safety of blood letting then seems to
depend on circumstances which can be only known,
and that perhaps with difficulty, at the time; nor can its
success in one season be a sufficient argument for the general
practice of it in another.</p>

<p>3. <i>Vomits</i> have generally been found dangerous. Dr.
Moseley, Dr. Rush, and indeed almost all who have practised
in this disease, say, that they cannot be ventured
upon without extreme caution. Dr. Chisholm, in imitation
of the Russian practice in the true plague, attempted
the cure of the Boullam fever by vomits;
but, as one half of those to whom they were exhibited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
died of the disease, he did not think there was any
encouragement to proceed. Perhaps as preventives they
might be useful, as it seems probable indeed that any
thing must be which tends to cleanse the alimentary
canal.</p>

<p>4. <i>Purgatives</i> are found extremely useful, both as preventives
and medicines. There are innumerable instances
where an incipient attack of the disease has been carried
off by a brisk purge. Dr. Chisholm was able to remove
the slighter cases of Boullam fever by purgatives. He
used at first glauber salts with two grains of tartarised
antimony, which generally proved emetic as well as purgative;
but he afterwards used with advantage the better
purging salts, rendering the solution palatable by the
addition of lime juice and sugar. But in all violent cases
he would depend on nothing but mercury.</p>

<p>5. <i>Stimulating medicines.</i> The stimulants commonly
used on the Brunonian plan, viz. opium, bark, &amp;c. are universally
owned to be pernicious. In a letter from Dr.
Sayres to Dr. Currie<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> the former says, that “bark,
wine, and a number of the common stimulants, were
given on the first appearance of debility taking place;
but with little success. Finding the common round
of medicine ineffectual in the advanced state of the
disease, I determined (says Dr. Sayres) to use a different
mode of treatment. In three cases of adults, two of
which had the black vomiting, and the third was in a
gore of putrid blood from the mouth and nose, I forbid
medicine, and directed very cold water and brandy
mixed strong, to be given as freely as possible. It
had the happy effect of checking the vomiting in two
cases, when the stomach had rejected every kind of
mild drink, &amp;c. and, by continuing that practice almost
so as to produce high intoxication, for two or
three days, these two cases were recovered almost from
a state of death. The third was apparently much
benefited for three days; but, being in a high putrescent
state when I saw him, and having lost a very considerable
quantity of blood from the mouth, nose, &amp;c. he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
died oil the ninth day.” In the Boullam fever Dr.
Chisholm used the Angustura bark in twelve cases, eight
of whom recovered; but, though it was greatly superior
to the Peruvian bark, he did hot think proper to trust
to it in violent cases.</p>

<p>6. <i>Alkaline remedies.</i> These have been recommended
on the supposition that the yellow fever is occasioned
by an acid. Their efficacy is attested by Dr. Jeremiah
Barker of Portland, who says that they afforded more relief
than any others, and that all the cases accompanied
with yellowness ended favourably, but one. The alkaline
remedies “would actually alleviate the distressing
pain and anguish at the stomach, which would not
yield to opiates. The morbid excitement too was <i>evidently</i>
under the controul of alkalies; the febrile disturbance
appeared to be in a direct ratio to the degree
of virulence in the deleterious cause.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> We have not
any particular details of cases, nor any form of exhibition
pointed out. In a dysenteric fever indeed he says that
he used a mixture of a quarter of an ounce of salt of
wormwood with a pound of lime water; the dose from
one to two ounces every hour, once in some cases every
half hour, or oftner, in an infusion of camomile<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span> Calcined
oyster shells were sometimes given from 40 to 60
grains.</p>

<p>7. <i>Cooling medicines, external and internal.</i> The good
effects of cold water applied to the body in fevers has
long been known. Dr. Jackson observes that it was first
introduced at Rome in the infancy of the Methodic
sect, and attained afterwards a high degree of celebrity.
Its reputation was highly raised by a cure performed on
the emperor Augustus; but soon after sunk by the
death of Marcellus, the presumptive heir to the empire, to
whom it had been improperly prescribed. It was soon after
prescribed again, and greatly used by Galen; and after
him was in still greater favour with the Arabian physicians;
but, since the revival of literature, has been much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
neglected till of late. In the fever of Jamaica, after the
fatal symptoms were removed, Dr. Jackson says, that the
tone and vigour of the system was best restored by cold
bathing, “which (says he) I am induced to consider as
the most important remedy in the cure of the fevers
of the West Indies, and perhaps in the cure of the
fevers of all hot climates. Though it might not absolutely
cut short the course of the disease, yet it seldom
failed to change the fatal tendency of its nature.”
Even in the last stage of the yellow fever, where the patient
seems at the utmost extremity, our author tells us
that he has alternately employed warm and cold bathing
with the greatest success. He has even wrapped the
body in a blanket soaked in water in which a large portion
of salt had been dissolved, or which had been steeped
in brandy or rum, enjoining the liberal use of wine,
or more powerful cordials. Dr. Wright also mentions
the cold bath with approbation; but, as it cannot be very
generally depended upon, its use ought never to supersede
that of other remedies, especially mercury; and
indeed this may be said of every thing else; for though
by the use of the remedies already mentioned the disease
has sometimes been subdued, yet the success has never
been so great but that every one under an attack of the
yellow fever must be considered as in very considerable
danger.</p>

<p>In the use of cooling medicines, taken internally, we
must have a particular regard to the state of the stomach,
which is excessively irritable; and it is surprising that
this irritability is of such a nature that, though it will
certainly reject the mildest drinks or medicines, it may
yet retain others seemingly much more acrid, as has already
been observed in the case of Dr. Sayres’s patients.
As long ago as the time of Diemerbroeck a solution of
common salt in vinegar was recommended in the plague.
Since that time it has been found extremely useful in the
dysentery; and, as in this disease the bowels are likewise
in an extremely irritable state, it would seem from analogy
that the same medicine might be useful also in the
yellow fever. Dr. Wright of Jamaica (who attests the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
efficacy of the medicine in dysentery, belly-ach, remittent
fever, and putrid sore throat) gives the following
improved method of preparing it: “Take of lime or
lemon juice three ounces; of marine salt as much as
the acid can dissolve; of any simple distilled cordial
water one pint; and of loaf sugar a sufficient quantity
to sweeten it. The dose of this mixture must be
proportioned to the age and sex of the patient, and to
the violence of the disease. A wine glassful may be
given to adults every two, four or six hours.”</p>

<p>8. <i>Medicines proper for relieving the most urgent symptoms
of the disease.</i> The most distressing symptoms attending
the yellow fever are, head-ach, vomiting, pain
in the stomach, and pains in the back, loins and limbs.
Blisters were tried by Dr. Chisholm to mitigate the pain
in the head. “I have (says he) blistered the whole head,
and the inside of each thigh, at once, in several cases,
without producing the least change in that or any
other symptom. I have had recourse to this remedy
to lessen pain, to remove irritability of the stomach,
and to raise the vital powers in the low, comatose stage,
but always except in two cases without success.” In
one a blister to the scrobiculus cordis completely removed
the irritability; the other case is related in the next
section. Another practitioner found a blister applied to
the forehead of remarkable use in four cases; but Dr.
Chisholm supposes them to have been of the less violent
kind. Others have also found them occasionally useful;
so that, though dependence cannot be placed upon
these remedies, it seems improper to reject them entirely.
But the most effectual method of allaying the irritability
of the stomach was by the exhibition of vitriolic æther.
Dr. Chisholm adopted the medicine on the recommendation
of M. Poissonier, and found it to answer the character
given of it by him. Dr. Chisholm gave about a
teaspoonful in half a glassful of cool water, after which
the patient continued undisturbed about two hours, when
the dose was repeated. Sometimes, though seldom, the
stomach was thus enabled to bear the bark, but otherwise
the æther was given every three hours. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
stomach retained the bark after the first dose, æther was
then given only once in five or six hours. Æther, says
he, given in the manner I have mentioned, is extremely
grateful to the patient; it occasions an agreeable warmth
along the oesophagus, and gently stimulates the stomach.
This effect, however, does not continue long; but the
frequent production of it at length gives it permanency.
It appears to act as a tonic, an antiseptic, and an agreeable
stimulant; a warm glow overspreads the surface;
and thirst, nausea and oppression, often have fled before
it.</p>

<p>These are the remedies most approved, and which may
with most reason be expected to succeed in the cure of
the disease, where it is <i>within the power of medicine</i>. But
there are certain cases in which medicines of the ordinary
kind cannot act. Sometimes, at the very beginning
of the disease, all the three stages of it seem to commence
at once, or to be mingled in such a manner that medicines
have not time to exert their force. Again, in the
last stage, Dr. Jackson compares the attempts to overcome
the torpor of the system by medicine, to that of attempting
to revive a dead corpse. “I have, however (says he)
seen instances of such unexpected recoveries from the
most hopeless state in fevers, that I seldom totally despair
as long as life remains.” It is evident, however,
that the remedies employed must be different, according
to the different times of the disease. In the beginning
it is probable that by bleeding to an extreme degree,
so that the greater part of the mass of blood was taken
away, the disease might be subdued at once, and the
patient recover, as has been already mentioned of the
plague, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_363">363</a>. But the idea of death seems to be so
firmly connected in the human mind with the loss of a
great quantity of blood, that very little hopes can be entertained
of any good being done in this way. It seems
indeed owing to this invincible association of ideas that
the enemies of Dr. Rush have found means to load him
so much and so undeservedly with reproach. Another
method, less exceptionable, though probably also less efficacious,
is by injections into the veins. But what are we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
to inject? Here, to the disgrace of experimenters, let it
be recorded, that such has been their innate propensity
to cruelty, that though we know a number of substances
which, injected into the veins of an animal, will <i>certainly</i>
kill it, yet we scarce know one which can be injected
with even a <i>probability</i> of doing good. In the Medical
Extracts indeed we find it related that at Guadaloupe a
physician had cured the most inveterate diseases by injecting
<i>certain remedies</i> into the veins. But what these
remedies were we know not. In the same paragraph indeed
it is said that alarming symptoms from the bite of
a viper were removed by injecting diluted <i>spirit of hartshorn</i>
into the blood. As the bite of a viper is attended
with a dissolution of the blood, and yellowness of the
skin, we may thence derive some faint hope that such an
injection might also be useful in desperate cases of the
yellow fever; but, till further experiments are made, we
can say nothing more on the subject.</p>

<p>Lastly, when the disease has proceeded so far that the
blood flows out from all parts of the body, and it is evident
that the patient must die were it only from the loss
of that fluid, then, if ever, the once celebrated remedy
of the transfusion of blood may be of use. An account
of this remedy has been given in the former part of this
work. It must be evident that human blood ought to
be preferred to that of a brute creature; but the danger
incurred by one who should lose a quantity of blood so
near to a person capable of giving the febrile infection
must certainly be very great. Nevertheless, there are
cases in which the death of a beloved object inspires
more horror than the thoughts of any personal danger,
or even death itself, to the person who beholds it. In such
cases no doubt there are many that would run all risks;
and, should any case prove successful, no doubt the
person who had the courage to make the experiment
would find ample recompense in saving a person he loved
from death, and in establishing a truth of such importance
to the world in general<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span></p>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Remarkable Cases.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap">S<span class="ls01em">O</span> many cases have been enumerated in the course of
this work, that little more remains to be done in
that way. The following are given, not merely on account
of their singularity, or to give instances of surprising
and unexpected recovery, but to elucidate some
points of doctrine hinted at before, and not sufficiently
explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Spontaneous burning.</i> In the former part of this
treatise several extraordinary instances of this kind are
given; but a doubt was suggested whether the fire was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
produced <i>internally</i>, or <i>externally</i>. The following account,
from the Medical Extracts, determines the matter.
The circumstance took place in England, in the
year 1613. One Hitchill, a carpenter, came home from
his work as usual, without being sensible of any indisposition,
and went to bed. In the night time, or early in
the morning, his wife awaked and found him dead by her
side. His body was so hot that it could not be touched,
and he continued burning internally for <i>three days</i>.
No flame appeared on the outside, only an hot steam issued
from his body; and we are not told what was the
ultimate effect of the fire, or whether his body was consumed
to ashes or not. In the same work we are told of
a woman who was found dead in her room in the morning,
and consumed to ashes, her very bones being calcined
to whiteness. The floor on which she lay was very
little burned. This last case, however, is not so directly
in point as the former, which seems decisive with regard
to the internal origin of the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span></p>

<p>2. <i>M. D’Obsonville’s case of the plague.</i> In the former
part of this treatise it has been said that heat destroyed
the plague; but, on the authority of the Russian
physicians, that the disease could not be treated in hot
rooms. The following case, however, shows that even
exposure to a burning sun in a desert, to the cold air of
night, and to the most injurious usage, cannot always
render fatal an attack even of the most dreadful distemper
in the world. M. D’Obsonville had undertaken a
journey over land to the East Indies, in order to execute
an important commission from the French government,
in 1761, the very time when the plague raged violently
in the east. He describes his case in the following
words: “I felt the first symptoms of the plague two small
days journey from Aleppo, when I had entered the
desert; and at night, when going to rest, complained
of a general uneasiness and heaviness of the head. In
the morning the fever was known to be inflammatory;
and from that time I had no longer any sleep.
The third, the fever and head-ach became more violent,
two buboes began to rise on my left side, my
tongue was swelled, and of a brown violet colour. The
fourth and fifth days, sores began to appear on my
loins, the spine of my back, and the scrotum; some
of which were as large as the palm of my hand, and
their colour at first was a red purple. I was obliged,
however, to rise, like other passengers, at two in the
morning, and travel on horseback till eleven. Unable
to swallow any thing but a little water, abandoned by
my Christian servant, who durst not come near me,
and attended by an Arab, that I could not understand,
the violence even of my illness, and a little fortitude,
had hitherto contributed to support me; but my
weakness increased hourly, and I could no longer sit
my horse, when an Armenian lady, named <i>Tcheremani</i>,
determined to ride him herself, and with the utmost
humanity gave up her camel to me, on which was a
kind of litter. On the sixth day the symptoms all
appeared aggravated; at one moment my pulse beat
with an astonishing quickness, and fire seemed to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
through my veins; and the next, my blood was intercepted
in its course, a moisture covered my forehead,
and I felt myself fainting, though without being
delirious, or losing my senses.”</p>

<p>The caravan having arrived at a small ruined village
named <i>Soccun</i>, in the desert, it was resolved to leave M.
D’Obsonville to his fate, his case being considered as desperate;
and indeed he says he was left alone at his own request.
A small horde of Arabs resided in that village,
though ruined, and our patient was consigned to the care
of a religious person called a <i>moullah</i>. This gentleman, like
too many others, did not choose to <i>serve God for nought</i>,
and therefore demanded fifty piastres in silver, besides
some effects, in recompense for the charity which he was
about to extend to the unhappy traveller. Having received
those, and the caravan being gone, the moullah
and his wife in the night time laid M. D’Obsonville
across an ass, and carried him about a mile into the desert,
where they left him to shift for himself. Happily,
however, either through accident or design, these religious
devils had deposited their prey near some water, which
undoubtedly, as he still retained his senses, was the means
of preserving his life. “It was there (says he) that, extended
upon the earth, with no other succour than a
little water, nature laboured to expel the poison by
which I was oppressed. One of the buboes burst of
itself; the pestilential sores, which appeared first of a
red purple, became yellowish, then brown, and lastly
black. These parts then becoming gangrenous, formed
hard and thick scabs, which, kernelling and falling
away from the quick flesh, left very deep ulcers. This
was the first epocha of health; an abundant suppuration
began, and the fever almost immediately left
me.”</p>

<p>Having remained alone in the desert for eight or ten
days, he was found by chance by some Arabian women,
who brought him to their place of residence, washed his
sores with water, brought him dried herbs for his bed,
and gave him barley bread, butter and curds for his
food; endeavouring besides by their songs to comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
him, and alleviate his distress as much as possible. With
these women he remained twenty days, reduced to an
extremity of weakness by reason of the discharge from
the sores. At last, having learnt a few Arabic words, he
prevailed upon two of the husbands to conduct him to
Aleppo, about seven days journey distant. He was now
mounted astride on a camel (a very hard trotting animal)
and by forced marches accomplished the journey
in six days, when he appeared before the consul, the
European merchants, and a crowd of people, in a condition
without example; almost naked, with five running
buboes, the little covering he had foul, infected with
ulcers as long as the palm of the hand, which had eaten
away the flesh, and in some places discovered the bones,
having besides two holes in the scrotum. From this
miserable condition he recovered in a month. It would
seem that in some cases the human body, as well as mind,
rises superior to every indignity; and that in proportion
to the degree of injury and oppression is the tenacity of
life, as well as energy of spirit.</p>

<p>3. <i>Remarkable cure of the plague by exposure to cold and
wet.</i> M. Savary relates that the captain of a vessel informed
him that, having touched at Constantinople
when the plague was raging there, some of his sailors
caught the distemper; two died suddenly, and by assisting
them he was infected. “I felt excessive heat
(says he) which made my blood boil; the disease seized
my head, and I perceived that I had only a few moments
to live. The little remaining reason I had
taught me to attempt an experiment. I laid myself,
quite naked, all night on the deck; the heavy dews
that fell penetrated to my very bones; in a few hours
I could breathe freer, and my head was better; my
agitated blood became calm, and, bathing the morning
after in the sea, I was perfectly cured.”</p>

<p>4. <i>Extraordinary effect of</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">FEAR</span> <i>in rendering the contagion
of the</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">SMALL POX</span> <i>effectual</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> “A very beautiful
girl, twenty-five years of age, servant to captain
Morton, had never had the small pox, and had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
most dreadful apprehensions of that disease. On the
twentieth of January, 1791, about four in the afternoon,
she was standing near the kitchen fire, when
a joiner in the neighbourhood came to the door, which
is about sixteen feet from the fire place where the girl
stood. Mrs. Morton found fault with the man for
not coming sooner to finish some work, and he excused
himself by saying his apprentice was ill of the
small pox, which had delayed him. The girl immediately
clasped her hands, and exclaimed, God forgive
you, but I will lay my death to you. From that moment
she became chilly, then hot and restless. She
passed a very bad night, frequently exclaiming, God
forgive Calder, he has killed me; meaning he had
given her the small pox. In the morning of the
twenty-first I was sent for, and found her very hot, with
a quick pulse, great sickness and anxiety. I ordered her
an emetic, and assured her she did not need to be in
the least alarmed, as she could not possibly have
caught the disease. She seemed to be convinced that
her fears were groundless; but next day, the twenty-second,
a violent rash appeared; on the twenty-third
the small pox came out, of the worst kind I had ever
seen, and she died on the ninth day from the eruption.”</p>

<p>5. <i>Inefficacy of</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">FEAR</span> <i>to render the contagion of</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">YELLOW
FEVER</span> <i>effectual</i>. Dr. Rush mentions a young
woman so exceedingly fearful of the disease, that she was
troublesome to all around her. Afterwards she happened
to be under the necessity of attending <i>seven</i> persons
ill of the fever, and yet escaped unhurt. This
shows that fear (and the same may be said of any predisposing
cause) is not always sufficient to produce the
disease. The foregoing case is so extraordinary that
Dr. Haygarth is of opinion that the patient must have
been previously infected; but of this there is no evidence;
and it is bad reasoning to endeavour to establish
a fact by our own ignorance. The only argument that
is or can be used in such cases is, “I cannot understand
how such a thing could have happened, <i>therefore</i> it <i>has
not</i> been so.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
6. <i>Boullam fever cured by a blister</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> The patient was
a tradesman in St. George’s, Grenada, and had “all the
symptoms of the disease except the febrile heat. A
blister was applied between the shoulders, without administering
any medicine previously except the solution
(mentioned p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_530">530</a>) which operated very moderately.
The effect was wonderful; the discharge was
uncommonly large, black, and fœtid in an intolerable
degree; and the instant this took place the patient
became better; and soon after, without the use of any
other remedy, recovered.”</p>

<p>7. <i>Yellow fever of Barbadoes cured by vomiting</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span> The
patient was a young man, about twenty-four years of
age, surgeon to a Guinea ship. Being a lover of spiritous
liquors, he had been drunk three days and nights successively,
and in that condition had run races with the sailors
on the shore, in the heat of the mid day sun. The
last night he slept in the open air under a tamarind tree,
and in the morning was seized with the fever, attended
with the most violent retching to vomit, insomuch that
he could scarcely answer yes or no to the questions asked
him by the Doctor. Sixteen ounces of blood were taken
away, which was very florid, thin and dissolved. He was
directed then to drink warm water to cleanse his stomach,
which he did to the amount of three gallons, which he
discharged, together with immense quantities of yellow
and blackish bilious matter. He then took a grain and
an half of opium, and slept some hours, after which a
dose of manna and tamarinds carried off by stool a good
deal more of bilious matter, and, with the help of some
elixir of vitriol, mint and snakeroot tea, he recovered in
a short time.</p>

<p>Dr. Rush, in a letter published in the newspapers
last year, after regretting the inefficacy of bleeding and
purging, suspects “that death occurred from the stagnation
of acrid bile in the gall-bladder, or its adherence
to the upper bowels, as mentioned by Dr. Mitchell
in 1741,” which he proposes to evacuate by strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
emetics and purgatives, so as to occasion an artificial
cholera morbus; and he greatly commends this mode
of practice. “Vomits (says he) are old remedies in the
yellow fever of the West Indies. I gave them on the
first day of the disease in the year 1793, and always
without success. They uniformly did harm when
given in the beginning of the fever in its worst grade,
in 1797. The reason of this failure in their efficacy
I now perceive was because they were given <i>before</i> the
violent morbid action in the system was reduced or
moderated by bleeding and purging. After this
change is introduced in the disease they are perfectly
safe. The time for exhibiting them should be regulated
by the pulse and other symptoms. In moderate
cases of the fever they are as proper in its first stage
as on the 4th day. As there is a blistering point in all
fevers, so there appears to be an <i>emetic point</i> in the
yellow fever. It may occur on the second, and it
may be protracted to the sixth or seventh day of the
disease. I have not given the medicine I have mentioned
in any case where the patient complained of
pain or burning in the stomach; but I have considered
a nausea, and a moderate degree of puking, as no obstacle
to its use; for Dr. Physic has taught me by his
dissections that these symptoms may exist without the
least inflammation in the stomach, and that they have
been absent where the stomach has appeared after
death to have been highly inflamed.</p>

<p>“The cure of the fever should not rest upon a single
dose of the medicine. I have given two doses of it in
a day in several cases, and have given it in one case
every day for three successive days.</p>

<p>“It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics
are exactly alike. They vary not only in different
climates, but in the same climate in different years.
They even vary with the changes of the weather in the
same season. The fever of 1797 differed in several
particulars from the fever of 1793; and the present
epidemic differs materially from both. In many of
the cases I have seen it exceeds the fever of last year in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
its malignity. These variations in diseases call for
corresponding changes in our practice.”</p>

<p>8. <i>Extraordinary case of yellow fever at Boston in 1798.</i>
“The subject of <span class="nowrap">it<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> was a female of about 24 years of
age, in the 9th month of pregnancy. I saw her on
Monday the 17th of September. She had then a small
but painful hardness on the left parotid gland, which
had commenced some days before, and soon extended
to the lips and neighbouring parts. The centre of the
tumour resembled that of the incision of an arm
about the time of the eruption of the small pox
after inoculation, exhibiting a hard, florid, shining
appearance. I recommended an emollient poultice,
hoping to procure suppuration; but, though
they were repeated steadily, not the least evidence
of matter could be produced; and upon each visit
I found the tumour had extended in a rapid and
formidable degree. I was called up in the course of
the night to her, and found her almost suffocated from
the pressure of the tumour on the trachea; for it had
now extended itself to all the muscles and glands of
the neck and face. I changed the poultice for an embrocation
of the saturnine preparations, which were repeated
till about 10 o’clock of the following morning,
when she was taken in travail, and soon delivered of
a healthy male child. For a few hours after her delivery
she appeared something better, but in the night
she grew worse, and about 12 o’clock I was called to
her, when she appeared to be expiring. At the request
of her friends I entered my lancet into the tumour
the length of the instrument; but, as I had expected,
not the least particle of matter flowed, and the
parts were <i>as hard as a schirrus</i>. She continued however
in agony till 3 o’clock of the day, and then
expired.”</p>

<p>9. <i>Two cases of spontaneous origin of yellow fever: from
the Medical Repository, vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 333. “At Salem
(Massachusetts) there was a general prevalence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
health at that season; though several cases of yellow
fever, and some of them fatal ones, occurred. Dr.
Oliver very judiciously inclines to the belief that the
exemption of this town from the ravages of yellow
fever is owing, 1st, to the remarkably clean state of
the town; and, 2dly, to the houses being placed at
such distances as to admit of free ventilation. It was
observable that the yellow fever had a <i>spontaneous</i>
origin in two different places of the town, where putrid
matters had been suffered to accumulate, and proved
fatal to two persons in different families; these unclean
spots forming exceptions to the generally purified
state of the town.”</p>

<p>10. <i>Case of fever produced by the effluvia of putrid beef.</i>
This took place in the federal garrison on Governor’s
Island<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> The subject was a soldier, who had been excused
from duty on account of a violent and obstinate
gonorrhœa. On removing him into a lodging without
the garrison he was seized with symptoms of fever, and
on the commencement of these the gonorrhœa ceased.
For four days the fever increased, and was attended at
last with vomiting, hiccup and delirium. From the
first commencement of the disease the physician had
been sensible of a very offensive smell in the patient’s
room. Being assured that this was not owing to want of
cleanliness, he caused search to be made under it, and in
the cellars found three barrels of beef so putrid that it
was with difficulty they could be removed, on account
of the stench. On removing them, however, the patient
rapidly recovered, though till then he had constantly
grown worse.</p>

War:&mdash;From</i> <span class="smcap">Thucydides</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smith</span>’<i>s
Translation.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">T<span class="ls01em">HE</span> Peloponnesians and their allies, who had made an incursion into
Attica, with two thirds of their forces, had not been many days there
before a sickness began first to appear among the Athenians, such as was reported
to have raged before this in other parts, as about Lemnos and other
places. Yet a plague so great as this, and so dreadful a mortality, in human
memory could not be paralleled. The physicians at first could administer no
relief, through utter ignorance; nay, they died the faster, the closer their attendance
on the sick; and all human art was totally unavailing. Whatever
supplications were offered in the temples, whatever recourse to oracles and
religious rites, all were insignificant: at last, expedients of this nature they
totally relinquished, overcome by calamity. It broke out first, as it is said, in
that part of Ethiopia which borders upon Egypt; it afterwards spread into
Egypt and Libya; and at length, on a sudden, fell on the city of the Athenians.
The contagion shewed itself first in Piræus; which occasioned a report,
that the Peloponnesians had caused poison to be thrown into the wells;
for, as yet, there were no fountains there. After this it spread into the upper
city, and then the mortality very much increased. Let every one, physician
or not, freely declare his own sentiments about it; let him assign any credible
account of its rise, or the causes strong enough, in his opinion, to introduce so
terrible a scene. I shall only relate what it actually was, and as, from an information
in all its symptoms, none may be quite at a loss about it if ever it
should happen again, I shall give an exact detail of them; having been sick of
it myself, and seen many others afflicted with it.</p>

<p>This very year, (430 B.&nbsp;C.) as is universally allowed, had been, more than
any other, remarkably free from common disorders; or, whatever diseases
had already seized the body, they ended at length in this. But those who enjoyed
the most perfect health were suddenly, without any apparent cause, seized
at first with head-achs extremely violent, with inflammations and fiery redness
in the eyes. Within, the throat and tongue began instantly to be red as blood;
the breath was drawn with difficulty, and had a noisome smell. The
symptoms that succeeded these were, sneezing and hoarseness; and, not long
after, the malady descended to the breast, with a violent cough; but, when
once settled in the stomach, it excited vomitings, in which was thrown up all
that matter which physicians call discharges of bile, attended with excessive
torture. A great part of the infected were subject to such violent hiccups,
without any discharge, as brought upon them strong convulsions, to some but
of a short, to others of a very long continuance. The body, to the outward
touch, was neither very hot nor of a pallid hue, but reddish, livid, marked all
over with little pustules and sores; yet, inwardly, it was scorched with such
excessive heat that it would not bear the slightest covering of the finest linen
upon it, but must be left quite naked. They longed for nothing so much
as to be plunging in cold water; and many of those who were not properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
attended threw themselves into wells, hurried by a thirst not to be
extinguished; and, whether they drank much or little, their torment still
continued the same. The restlessness of their bodies, and an utter inability
of composing themselves to sleep, never abated for a moment. And the
body, so long as the distemper continued in its height, had no visible waste,
but withstood its rage to a miracle; so that most of them perished within seven
or nine days by the heat that scorched their vitals, though their strength was
not exhausted; or, if they continued longer, the distemper fell into the belly,
causing violent ulcerations of the bowels, accompanied with an incessant flux,
by which many, reduced to an excessive weakness, were carried off. For the
malady, beginning in the head, and settling first there, sunk afterwards
gradually down through the whole body. And whoever got safe through all
its most dangerous stages, yet the extremities of their bodies still retained the
marks of its violence. For it shot down into their privy members, into
their fingers and toes, by losing which they escaped with life. Some there
were who lost their eyes, and some who, being quite recovered, had at once
totally lost all memory, and quite forgot not only their most intimate friends,
but even their own selves. For, as this distemper was in general virulent beyond
expression, and its every part more grievous than had yet fallen to the lot
of human nature; so, in one particular instance, it appeared to be none of the
natural infirmities of man, since the birds and beasts that prey on human flesh
either never approached the dead bodies, of which many lay about uninterred,
or certainly perished if they tasted. One proof of this is then the total disappearance
of such birds; for not one was to be seen, either in any other place,
or about any of the carcases. But the dogs, because of their constant familiarity
with man, afforded a more notorious proof of this event.</p>

<p>The nature of this pestilential disorder was in general (for I have purposely
omitted many of its varied appearances, or the circumstances particular to
some of the infected in contradistinction to others) such as hath been described.
None of the common maladies incident to human nature prevailed at that
time; or, whatever disorder any where appeared, it ended in this. Some died
merely for want of care; and some with all the care that could possibly be
taken; nor was any one medicine discovered from whence could be promised
any certain relief; since that which gave ease to one was prejudicial to another.
Whatever difference there was in bodies in point of strength, or in point of
weakness, it availed nothing; all were equally swept away before it, in spite
of regular diet, and studied prescriptions. Yet the most affecting circumstances
of this calamity were, that dejection of mind which constantly attended the
first attack; for the mind sinking at once into despair, they soon gave themselves
up without a struggle; and that mutual tenderness in taking care of one
another, which communicated the infection, and made them drop like sheep.
This latter case caused the mortality to be so great. For, if fear withheld
them from going near one another, they died for want of help; so that many
houses became desolate for want of needful attendance; and if they ventured,
they were gone. This was most frequently the case of the kind and compassionate.
Such persons were ashamed, out of a selfish concern for themselves,
entirely to abandon their friends, when their menial servants, no longer able
to endure the groans and lamentations of the dying, had been compelled to fly
from such a weight of calamity. But those, especially, who had safely gone
through it, took pity on the dying and the sick, because they knew by themselves
what it really was, and were now secure in themselves; for it never
seized one a second time so as to be mortal. Such were looked upon as quite
happy by others, and were themselves at first overjoyed in their late escape,
and the groundless hope that hereafter no distemper would prove fatal to them.
Besides this reigning calamity, the general removal from the country into the
city was a heavy grievance, more particularly to those who had been necessitated
to come thither. For, as they had no houses, but dwelled all the summer
time in booths, where there was scarce room to breathe, the pestilence
destroyed them with the utmost disorder, so that they lay together in heaps,
the dying upon the dead, and the dead upon the dying. Some were tumbling
over one another in the public streets, or lay expiring about every fountain,
whither they had crept to assuage their extraordinary thirst. The temples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
in which they had erected tents for their reception, were full of the bodies
which had expired there. For, in a calamity so outrageously violent, and universal
despair, things sacred and holy had quite lost their distinction. Nay,
all regulations observed before in matters of sepulture were quite confounded,
since every one buried where he could find a place. Some, whose sepulchres
were already filled by the numbers which had perished in their own families,
were shamefully compelled to seize those of others. They surprised on a sudden
the piles which others had built for their own friends, and burned their
dead upon them; and some, whilst one body was burning on a pile, tossed
another body they had dragged thither upon it, and went their way.</p>

<p>Thus did the pestilence first give rise to those iniquitous acts which prevailed
more and more in Athens. For every one was now more easily induced
openly to do what for decency they did only covertly before. They saw the
strange mutability of outward condition; the rich entirely cut off, and their
wealth pouring suddenly on the indigent and necessitous; so that they thought
it prudent to catch hold of speedy enjoyments and quick gusts of pleasure;
persuaded that their bodies and their wealth might be their own merely for
the day. Not any one continued resolute enough to form any honest or generous
design, when so uncertain whether he should live to effect it. Whatever
he knew could improve the pleasure or satisfaction of the present moment,
that he determined to be honour and interest. Reverence of the gods,
or of the laws of society, laid no restraints upon them; either judging that
piety or impiety were things indifferent, since they saw that all men perished
alike; or, throwing away every apprehension of being called to account for
their enormities, since justice might be prevented by death; or rather, as the
heaviest judgment to which man could be doomed was already hanging
over their heads, snatching this interval of pleasure before it fell.</p>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Account of the Great Plague in the time of</i> <span class="smcap">Justinian</span>:&mdash;<i>By</i>
<span class="smcap">Procopius</span>.</p>


<p class="dropcap">T<span class="ls01em">HIS</span> was a plague which almost consumed mankind; of which Procopius
concludes there was no other cause than the immediate hand of God
himself. For it neither came upon one part of the world alone, nor in one
season of the year; whence subtile wits (as he saith) might make pretensions.
It afflicted the whole world, and all conditions of men, though of never so
contrary a nature and disposition; sparing no constitution nor age. The difference
of men as to their places of dwelling, diet, complexions, inclinations,
&amp;c. did no good in this disease. Some it took in summer, some in winter,
and others in other seasons. It began among the Egyptians in Pelusium, and
spread to Alexandria, with the rest of Egypt, one way, and the other to those
parts of Palestine which border upon Egypt. From thence it travelled to the
utmost bounds of the world, as by set journies and stages, making destruction
its only business, and sparing neither island, cave, nor top of mountain, where
mankind inhabited; for, if it leaped over a country, returning afterwards,
it left it no cause to rejoice above its fellows. It began still at the sea coast,
and thence went to the inland parts. In the second year of its progress it
arrived at Constantinople, about the middle of the spring, where it was the
fortune of Procopius then to reside. Apparitions of spirits, in all shapes human,
were seen by many, who thought the man they met struck them in
some part of the body; and so soon as they saw the spirit they were seized with
the disease. At first when they met them they repeated divine names, and
fled into churches, to no purpose. Afterwards they were afraid to hear their
friends call them, locking themselves up in their chambers, and stopping their
ears. Some dreamed they saw such sights; others that they heard a voice
tell them they were enrolled among the number of those appointed to die.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
But most, without warning, became feverish suddenly: their bodies changed
not colour, nor were hot; the fever being so remiss till evening, that neither
the patient nor physician, by his pulse, could apprehend any danger. Yet to
some the same day, to others the next, or many days after, arose a bubo, either
in the groin, the armpit, under the ear, or in other parts. These were
the general symptoms which happened alike to all the visited persons.</p>

<p>There were others different; whether made so by the diversity of bodies,
or by the will and pleasure of him that sent the distemper, our author cannot
say. Some were seized with drowsiness and slumbering, others with a sharp
distraction. The slumberers forgot all things: if they were looked to, some
would eat; some, that were neglected, starved to death. Those who were
distracted were vexed with apparitions; crying there were men to kill them;
and running away; being so troublesome and unruly that their keepers were
pitied as much as they themselves. No physician or other caught the disease
by touching sick or dead bodies; many strangely continuing free, though they
tended and buried infected persons, and many catching it they knew not how,
and dying instantly. Many leapt into the water, though not from thirst; and
some into the sea. Some, without slumbering or madness, had their bubo
gangrened, and died with extreme pain; which doubtless also happened to
those who had the phrensy, though, being not themselves, they understood it
not. Some physicians hereupon, conceiving the venom and head of the disease
to lie in those plague sores, opened the dead bodies, and, searching the
sores, found an huge carbuncle growing inward. Such whose bodies were
spotted with black pimples, the bigness of a lentile, lived not a day. Many
died vomiting blood. Some that were given over by the most eminent physicians
unexpectedly recovered; others, of whose recovery they thought themselves
perfectly secure, suddenly perished. No cause of this sickness could
be reached by man’s reason. Some received benefit by bathing, others it
hurt. Many died for want of relief, others escaped without it. In a word,
no way could there be found of preservation, either by preventing the sickness,
or of mastering the disease, no cause appearing either of their falling sick
or recovery. Women with child, who were visited, certainly died; some
miscarrying, some fairly delivered, and perishing with their children. Three
women only were safely brought to bed and recovered, their children dying;
and one died whose child had the hap to live. Such as had their sores
great, and running plentifully, escaped; the violence of the carbuncles being
thereby assuaged; and this was the most certain sign of health. Such
whose sores staid as they first arose, underwent the miserable accident formerly
mentioned. Some had their thighs withered, when the sores rose
upon them and did not run. Some escaped with diminished tongues, and
lived stammering, or uttering sounds without distinction, all their days. In
Constantinople the pestilence lasted four months; raging three months with
all extremity. In the beginning few died more than usual. Then, growing
hotter and hotter, it came to five, and at last to ten thousand every day. At
first they buried their dead carefully; but at length all came to confusion,
and many lay long unburied; servants were without masters; rich men had
none to attend them. In the afflicted city little was to be seen but empty
houses, no trade going, or shops open.</p>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Account of the Plague at London in 1665</i>:&mdash;<i>From Dr.</i>
<span class="smcap">Hodges</span> <i>and others.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap">I<span class="ls01em">N</span> the beginning of September 1664 the people of London first became
alarmed by a report of the plague being broke out in Holland, where it
raged violently the former year. The United Provinces had received it from
some place in the Levant, and, certain accounts having been received of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
distemper being in Holland, several councils were held by government with a
view of concerting means for preventing its introduction into Britain. These
were held privately, and it does not appear that any thing was positively determined
upon; but thus the knowledge that such a distemper existed in
Holland was suppressed, and the public fears dissipated until the beginning
of December; when two, supposed to be Frenchmen<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span> in Long-acre, or rather
the upper end of Drury lane, died with such suspicious symptoms that the
people of the house endeavoured to conceal the distemper of which they died.
The secretaries of state, however, having got intelligence of the matter, caused
their bodies to be inspected, when it became evident they had died of the
plague. This produced a general alarm; Dr. Hodges says, that “hereupon
some timorous neighbours, under apprehensions of a contagion, removed into
the city of London; who unfortunately carried along with them the pestilential
taint; whereby that disease, which was before in its infancy, in a family
or two, suddenly got strength, and spread abroad its fatal poison; and,
merely for want of confining the persons first seized with it, the whole city
was irrecoverably infected.” The author of the Journal, however, says
that the public fear again subsided, though it had been still farther raised by
the death of another person in the same house about the latter end of December;
but, as no more died for six weeks, no farther notice was taken of it until
the 12th of February, when one died in another house, but in the same
parish. Soon after this an increase was observed in the weekly list of burials
at St. Giles’s parish, which augmented the general alarm so much that few
cared to pass through Drury lane or the suspected streets, unless upon very
urgent business. In a short time a like augmentation was perceived in the
bills of the adjoining parishes, and indeed all over the town. The Journal
informs us that the usual number of burials within the bill of mortality was
from 240 to 300; but from the 20th of December to January 24th they had gradually
arisen from 291 to 474. This seems inconsistent with what he had before
said of the alarm having ceased till the 12th of February; but we shall
take his own words. “This last bill (474) was really frightful; being a
greater number than had been known to have been buried in one week since
the preceding visitation of 1656. However, all this went off again, and the
weather proving cold, and the frost, which began in December, continuing
very severe, even till near the end of February, attended with sharp though
moderate winds, the bills decreased again, and the city grew healthy, and
every body began to look upon the danger as good as over; only that still
the burials in St. Giles’s continued high. From the beginning of April especially,
they stood at 25 each week, till the week from the 18th to the
25th, when there were buried in St. Giles’s parish 30; whereof were two
of the plague, and eight of the spotted fever, which was looked upon as the
same thing; likewise the number that died of the spotted fever on the
whole increased; being eight the week before, and twelve the week above
named.”</p>

<p>Thus a new and still greater alarm was produced, which was yet farther
augmented by the spreading of the distemper. The journalist says indeed
that only a few were set down in the lists as having died of the plague; the
remainder of the deaths being charged to other distempers; and accordingly
one week, when the mortality bill was high, and only 14 charged to the plague,
he says, “this was all knavery and collusion; for in St. Giles’s parish they
buried 40 in all; whereof it was certain that most of them died of the
plague, though they were set down of other distempers; and though the
number of all the burials was not increased above 32, and the whole bill
being but 385, yet there were 14 of the spotted fever, as well as 14 of the
plague; and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were 50 died
of the plague that week. The next bill was from the 23d of May to the
30th, when the number of the plague was 17; but the burials in St. Giles’s
were 53; a frightful number, of whom they set down but nine of the
plague; but, on examination more strictly by the justices of the peace, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
at the lord mayor’s request, it was found there were 20 more who were really
dead of the plague in that parish, but had been set down of the spotted fever,
or other distempers, besides others concealed.”</p>

<p>The account given by Dr. Hodges is somewhat different from the above.
He informs us that “a very hard frost began in December and continued
three months, which seemed greatly to diminish the contagion, and very
few died during that season; though even then it was not totally extinguished.”
The journalist says that in this intermission of the plague there was
a difficulty which he could not well get over. The first person who died of
the plague he says (p.&nbsp;234) was on December 20th, or thereabouts, 1664, though
he had told us before (p.&nbsp;2) that it was the end of November, or <i>beginning</i>
of December the same year. “But after this (continues he) we heard no more
of any person dying of the plague, or the distemper being in that place, till
the 9th of February, which was about seven weeks after; and then one more
was buried out of the same house: then it was hushed, and we were perfectly
easy as to the public for a great while, for there were no more entered
in the weekly bill to be dead of the plague, till the 22d of April. Now
the question seems to be thus: Where lay the seeds of the infection all
this while? How came it to stop so long, and not to stop any longer? Either
the distemper did not immediately come by contagion from body to body,
or, if it did, then a body may continue to be infected without the disease
discovering itself many days, nay, weeks together. It is true there
was a very cold winter, and long frost, which continued three months; and
this, the Doctors say, might check the infection; but then the learned must
allow me to say that if, according to their notion, the disease was, as I
may say, only frozen up, it would, like a frozen river, have returned to its usual
force and current when it thawed; whereas the principal recess of the infection,
which was from February to April, was after the frost was broken,
and the weather mild and warm. But there is another way of solving all
this difficulty, which I think my own remembrance of the thing will supply;
and that is, the fact is not granted, namely, that there died none in
those long intervals, viz. from the 20th of December to the 9th of February,
and from thence to the 22d of April. The weekly bills are the only evidence
on the other side, and those bills were not of credit enough, at least
with me, to support an hypothesis, or determine a question of such importance
as this: for it was our received opinion at that time, and I believe
upon very good grounds, that the fraud lay in the parish officers, searchers
and persons appointed to give account of the dead, and what diseases they died
of; and, as people were very loth at first to have the neighbours believe
their houses were infected, so they gave money to procure, or otherwise procured,
the dead persons to be returned as dying of other distempers; and this,
I know, was practised afterwards in many places; I believe I might say in all
places where the distemper came; as might be seen by the vast increase of
the numbers placed in the weekly bills under other articles of diseases,
during the time of the infection. For example, in the months of July and
August, when the plague was coming on to its highest pitch, it was very
ordinary to have from 1000 to 1200, nay to almost 1500, a week, of other
distempers: not that the numbers of those distempers were really increased
to such a degree; but the great number of families and houses where really
the infection was, obtained the favour to have their dead returned of other
distempers, to prevent the shutting up of their houses.”</p>

<p>The disease continued to advance, but with such intervals and remissions as
frequently gave hopes of its disappearing entirely. Nevertheless, about the
beginning of May the inhabitants began to leave the city in great numbers.
The journalist, for his own part, was irresolute; and sometimes would have left
the city with the rest, had it not been for the impossibility of finding an horse;
“for, (says he) though it is true that all the people did not go out of the city
of London, yet I may venture to say that in a manner all the horses did;
for there was hardly a horse to be bought or hired in the whole city for some
weeks.” Many fled on foot, carrying with them soldiers’ tents, in which
they slept in the fields, it being then warm weather, and no danger of taking
cold. This way of living was also familiar in some degree by reason of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
wars which had preceded; multitudes of those who had served in them being
at that time in London. This our author greatly approves of as a method of
preventing the infection from spreading, and thinks that had it been more
generally practised, much less damage would have been done in the country
than happened at the time from this dreadful distemper.</p>

<p>Early in June the court thought proper to remove to the city of Oxford,
whither the infection did not reach. The people still continued to remove
during the whole month of July though in smaller numbers than before; but
in August the multitude of fugitives so increased that says our author, “I began
to think there would be none but magistrates and servants left.” He informs
us also that at the breaking out of this plague the city was unusually full
of people; vast numbers who had served in the wars or who in times of trouble
had been friends to royalty had flocked into it on the restoration of
Charles II, in hopes of reaping some fruit of their former labours and sufferings;
so that on the whole he supposes there must have been upwards of an
hundred thousand people more than usual in the city. Indeed if we are to
believe that, on a representation of the state of the poor to the lord mayor, it
appeared that there were an hundred thousand ribband weavers in Spittle-fields,
we must look upon the population of London at that time to have been incredibly
great; and when the journalist computes the number of those who fled
only at two hundred thousand, we must certainly suppose it to have been
greatly underrated.</p>

<p>As the plague continued to become more and more violent, the magistrates
thought proper to take some means for separating the infected from the
healthy; but unhappily their mode of procedure was such as inspired both the
infected and uninfected with the utmost terror. The houses were marked with
a red cross, subscribed with the words “<span class="smcap">Lord, have mercy upon us!</span>”
in large letters. They were continually guarded, day and night; and none
were allowed access to the sick, to give them either food or medicines, excepting
those who guarded them; nor were the sick themselves allowed to go
abroad until forty days after their recovery. But, though the distemper
continually advanced, it did not get to its full height until the months of August
and September. Before this time it seemed to fly from place to place;
so that great hopes were entertained, though always without foundation, of
its total removal; but now it invaded the whole city. Four or five thousand
died in a week; once eight thousand; and, in the month of September, for
some time, twelve thousand a week died. The city was reduced to the extremity
of distress.</p>

<p>The author of this journal had the courage not only to remain in the city,
during the whole time of the infection, but even took many solitary walks to
the house of his brother, who had removed into the country, in order to preserve
his goods from being stolen. At first he went every day, but afterwards
only once or twice a week. He tells us also that he took many walks out of
curiosity; and, though he generally came home frighted and terrified, he
could not restrain himself. “In those walks (says he) I had many dismal
scenes before my eyes; as particularly of persons falling dead in the streets,
terrible shrieks, and screamings of women, who, in their agonies, would
throw open their chamber windows, and cry out in a dismal, surprising manner.</p>

<p>“It is scarce credible what dreadful cases happened in particular families
every day; people in the rage of the distemper, or in the torment of their
swellings, which was indeed intolerable, running about raving and distracted;
and oftentimes laying violent hands upon themselves, throwing themselves
out at their windows, shooting themselves, &amp;c. mothers murdering their
own children, in their lunacy; some dying of mere grief as a passion; some of
fright and surprise, without any infection at all; others frighted into idiotism
and foolish distractions, some into despair and lunacy; others into melancholy
madness.”</p>

<p>The distemper was found to rage so violently among the poorer sort, that
we are told by Dr. Hodges, some gave it the name of the <i>poor’s plague</i>.
This is confirmed by the journalist, who informs us that “the misery of that
time lay chiefly upon the poor, who, being infected, had neither food nor
physic; neither physician nor apothecary to assist them, nor nurse to attend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
them; many of those died calling for help, and even for sustenance, out of
their windows, in a most miserable and deplorable manner; but it must be
added, that, whenever the cases of such persons or families were represented
to the lord mayor, they were always relieved.” Indeed the charity of the
more opulent, upon this occasion, almost exceeds belief. Dr. Hodges informs
us, that “though the more opulent had left the town, and it was left almost
uninhabited, the commonalty who remained felt little of want; for their
necessities were relieved with a profusion of good things from the wealthy,
and their poverty was supported with plenty.” The probable reason of such
devastation among the poor, Dr. Hodges promises, p.&nbsp;15, to give, and does
not; at least I have not been able to find it in his book; I must therefore
content myself with what the journalist (though no physician) has delivered
on this subject. He says, that when people began to use proper cautions, the
danger of infection was the less.  “But (says he) it was impossible to beat any
thing into the heads of the poor; they went on with the usual impetuosity
of their tempers; full of outcries and lamentations when taken, but madly
careless of themselves, fool-hardy and obstinate when well: where they
could get employment, they pushed into any kind of business, the most dangerous,
and the most liable to infection; and, if they were spoken to, their
answer would be, I must trust to <span class="smcap">God</span> for that; if I am taken, then I am
provided for, and there is an end of me, or the like; or thus: Why, what
must I do? I cannot starve; I had as good have the plague, as perish for
want. I have no work, &amp;c. This adventurous conduct of the poor was
what brought the plague among them in a most furious manner; and this,
joined to the distress of their circumstances, when taken (with the distemper)
was the reason why they died so in heaps: for I cannot say that I
could observe one jot of better husbandry among them, I mean the labouring
poor, while they were well and getting money, than there was before;
but as lavish, as extravagant, and as thoughtless of to morrow, as ever; so
that, when they came to be taken sick, they were immediately in the utmost
distress, as well for want as for sickness, as well for lack of food as
lack of health.”</p>

<p>In the time of so great a calamity, the magistrates exerted themselves as far
as their power and skill would permit, to lessen the sufferings of the people.
It was natural also in such a dreadful emergency to call upon the physicians
to exert themselves. Accordingly the king (Charles II) by his royal authority
commanded the College of Physicians of London jointly to write somewhat
in English, that might be a general directory in this calamitous exigence;
nor was it satisfactory to this honoured society to discharge their regards for
the public in that only; but some were chosen out of their number, and appointed
particularly to attend the infected on all occasions; two also out of the
court of aldermen were required to see this hazardous task executed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span></p>

<p>Our author then proceeds to mention the names of some who were employed
in this laudable undertaking; particularly Dr. Glisson, regius professor at
Cambridge, Dr. Nathaniel Paget, Dr. Wharton, Dr. Berwick and Dr.
Brookes; many others he says were employed; “but (he adds) eight or nine
fell in the work, who were too much loaded with the spoils of the enemy;
among whom was Dr. Conyers, &amp;c. After, then, all endeavours to restrain
the contagion had proved of no effect, we applied ourselves altogether to the
cure of the diseased.”</p>

<p>We shall not doubt of the good intentions of the physicians: of their success
we may judge from what Dr. Hodges himself says, that many died while prescribing
cures for others. To the same purpose the journalist, p.&nbsp;43: “I
shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of the physicians,
when I say that the violence of the distemper, when it came to its extremity,
was like the fire the next year (1666). The fire which consumed what the
plague could not touch, defied all the application of remedies; the fire-engines
were broken, the buckets thrown away, and the power of man was
baffled and brought to an end; so the plague defied all medicine; the
very physicians were seized with it, with their preservatives in their mouths;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
and men went about prescribing to others, and telling them what to do,
till the tokens were upon them, and they dropped down dead, destroyed by
that very enemy they directed others to oppose. This was the case of several
physicians, even some of the most eminent, and of several of the most skilful
surgeons; abundance of quacks too died, who had the folly to trust to their
own medicines,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus, in defiance of every effort of human skill, the calamity continued.
“The contagion (says Dr. Hodges) spread its cruelties into the neighbouring
countries; for the citizens, who crowded in multitudes into the adjacent
towns, carried the infection along with them, where it raged with equal
fury; so that the plague, which at first crept from one street to another, now
reigned over whole counties, leaving hardly any place free from its insult,
and the towns upon the Thames were more severely handled; not, perhaps,
from a greater moisture in the air from thence, but from the tainted goods
rather, that were carried upon it: moreover some cities and towns, of the
most advantageous situation for a wholesome air, did, notwithstanding, feel
the common ruin. Such was the rise, and such the progress, of this cruel
destroyer, which first began at London.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span></p>

<p>But it is now time to turn from those scenes of horror. The power of the
pestilential contagion was not absolutely <i>immeasurable</i>. It had its rise, its
progress, its state and declension. Dr Hodges tells us that, <i>when</i> “<i>the worst
part of the year was over, and the height of the disease</i>, the plague by leisurely
degrees declined, and before the number infected decreased, its malignity
began to relax, insomuch that few died, and those chiefly such as were ill
managed; hereupon that dread which had been upon the minds of the
people wore off; and the sick cheerfully <i>used all the means directed for their
recovery</i>; and even the nurses grew either more cautious, or more faithful;
insomuch that after some time a dawn of health appeared, as sudden, and as
unexpected, as the cessation of the following conflagration; wherein, after
blowing up of houses, and using all means for its extinction to little purpose,
the flames stopped as it were of themselves for want of fuel, or, <i>out of shame</i>,
for having done so much mischief. The pestilence, however, did not stop for
want of subjects to act upon, (as then commonly rumoured) but from the
nature of the distemper. Its decrease was, like its beginnings, moderate, &amp;c.
About the close of the year, that is, on the beginning of November, people
grew more healthful,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The numbers who perished in this violent plague are so variously reported
that nothing certain can be said concerning it. Dr. Morton says that upwards
of forty thousand died; but from the foregoing accounts it is evident that
this calculation must be prodigiously underrated. The journalist indeed gives
strong reasons for believing that all the accounts of the numbers who perished
were much below the truth. He thinks that an hundred thousand at least
must have fallen victims to it; and if his own assertion be true, that thirty
thousand died in the last three weeks, we cannot suppose but that three times
that number died in the course of the twelvemonth that the disease lasted;
which would fix the calculation at 120,000. This great mortality however
was soon forgot; as soon as the danger was over, the ravages it had committed
were no longer an object of terror. The disease had its usual effect, viz. increasing
the desire of the sexes for each other. “They had the courage (says
Dr. Hodges) now to marry again, and betake to the means of repairing the
past mortality; and even women before deemed barren were said to prove
prolific; so that, although the contagion had carried off, as some computed,
about one hundred thousand, after a few months their loss was hardly discernible.”</p>

treatise, that no particular detail is requisite here. In its symptoms it
differed little if any thing from the plague of London, described in the former
number. Many died without any previous sickness, and, while the distemper
continued severe, few outlived the third day; and so infectious was its nature,
that one person in a family was seldom attacked without its successively attacking
all the rest. The bodies were said to putrefy in 24 hours. Very
considerable sums of money were collected here, as well as in London. The
conduct of the bishop on this melancholy occasion has been greatly celebrated
by many; among others by Dr. Darwin, in his Botanic Garden, in

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Account of the Plague in Syria, Cyprus &amp;c.&mdash;From Dr.</i>
<span class="smcap">Patrick Russel</span>’<i>s Treatise</i>.</p>


<p class="dropcap">T<span class="ls01em">HIS</span> plague was preceded by violent cold, famine, and earthquakes.
In 1759 it began in Egypt, having been imported in a vessel from
Constantinople. from Alexandria in Egypt it was brought by some Jews
to Saffat, a village in Syria, near Aleppo, which had suffered much by the
earthquake; which last was for some time thought to have been the cause
of the distemper; but, when its nature was really discovered, they comforted
themselves with the thoughts that an <i>Egyptian</i> plague was less to be dreaded
than one which came from the northward.</p>

<p>The distemper had been introduced into Cyprus as early as April 1759,
by a vessel from Constantinople, wrecked on the coast; and, having thus
got a footing in Egypt, Syria and Cyprus, its progress was marked with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
usual mortality. In Egypt the Europeans in Cairo remained in confinement
till the middle of July; a space considerably longer than usual. Next year
they shut up on the 9th of March, but were released on the 24th of June.
The distemper raged in the city with such fury during 1759 and 1760, that
in the two years four hundred and fifty thousand were computed to have
perished; a number, however, which Dr. Russel thinks must have been exaggerated.
Cairo had been free from plague during the whole of this century
before, except in the year 1736, when the distemper raged with such violence
that ten thousand were said to have perished in one day. It was supposed to
have been brought from Upper Egypt. In Cyprus it broke out at the village
of Limsol, where it destroyed four hundred people. During the hot months
of July, August and September the infection showed itself so little that it was
thought to have been extinguished; but in October it not only reappeared in
the places where it had before showed itself, but invaded Nicosia, the capital
of the island. Endeavours were used, by burying the dead bodies in the
night, to conceal the existence of the distemper; but this soon became impracticable.
Towards the end of January, 1760, it raged so dreadfully in
this city that the Mahometans were enjoined to use prayers and processions
to avert the wrath of Heaven. The crowds brought together on this occasion
spread the distemper still more wide, and in the following month its ravages
began at Larnica, a small town considerable for its trade, and which, though
alarmed, had hitherto kept free, even though infected persons had been freely
admitted. Here it raged with uncommon malignity, insomuch that few of
those recovered that were infected during the month of March. It continued
to prevail till the month of April, when it spread to the very eastern extremity
of the island, into the province of Carpass; a thing hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>Two examples of apparent insusceptibility are related; one was a young
Greek, whose constant employment was, to nurse the sick, and assist at the
burials; the other, a Greek woman, who, having with great affection nursed
her husband and two daughters who died of the plague, continued with admirable
courage to expose herself in assisting the sick in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May the infection was rapidly decreasing; the Europeans
came out of their confinement in the month of July, and the plague at
last ceased, after having destroyed 70,000 persons; nearly one half of the
whole population.</p>

<p>In Syria the plague appeared first in October, 1759, in the village of Saffat.
From thence it proceeded to Tripoli, where it began about the middle of
January, and did not decline till July; neither were the Europeans thoroughly
released from their confinement till towards the end of August. One
half of those infected are said to have recovered; but five thousand perished.
The city remained free from any attack during the whole of 1761; but early
in 1762 the distemper again made its appearance in the neighbouring villages,
and again began its devouring ravages; but, though a free access was granted
to infected persons in the city, it does not appear that any general infection
took place.</p>

<p>In Latarkea the distemper appeared in March, 1760, made considerable progress
during the month of April, increased from the 17th of that month to
the 13th of May, raged with great violence from that time to the 27th of
June, when it suddenly decreased, the funerals falling from 20 to 9. On
the 4th and 5th of July they again rose to more than 20 but presently fell
below six. Four thousand were supposed to have died, though it was thought
that as many recovered as perished. At Jerusalem the contagion discovered
itself in January or February, 1760, and about the middle of March reached
Damascus. In both places it made great havock; but no accurate accounts
were kept of those who died.</p>

<p class="tac fs95"><i>Remarkable case of a Remitting Fever at Bassorah in 1780.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap">I<span class="ls01em">N</span> the first part of this treatise we have given an account of the fever which
prevailed at Bassorah during the year we speak of, and likewise of the
journey of the gentleman from Bassorah to Zebire, where he was taken ill on
the 4th of June; but as the first attack went off for that day, we shall only
begin the narrative from the day following, as he himself does in these words:</p>

<p>5th June. From this day I date the actual commencement of my fever.
About 2 o’clock after dinner I was suddenly attacked with a violent glowing
heat all over my body, uneasiness, anxiety and oppression, but in a very inconsiderable
degree to what I afterwards experienced; also a swelling in my
tongue, which had been coming on some days, and is one of the first symptoms
of the fever that prevailed. The fit continued about two hours; a
slight perspiration succeeded, which removed the fever, but left a head-ach,
thirst, and pains in my back and limbs. In the evening with assistance I got
upon the terrace, when the moon and stars appeared of a bright yellow, and
all objects had that colour through the whole of my disease; also the pain in
making water, and across my loins, became intolerable, like that felt in complaints
of the stone in the bladder. I took some tartar emetic, which brought
up a great deal of bile, and the next morning a purgative of Rochelle salts,
manna, tamarinds and anniseeds.</p>

<p>6th June. In the forenoon a free, copious perspiration, and a perfect intermission
of the fever; at night became very restless and uneasy, could not
sleep, which I partly imputed to a draught of strong mustard whey, with
some antimonial wine, which, instead of causing perspiration, produced the
opposite effect.</p>

<p>7th. By the advice of a physician I took some weak decoction of bark, 1&nbsp;oz.
to two pints boiled to one, in the quantity of three tea-cupfuls before dinner.
At three in the afternoon I had another hot fit, but not very severe. In the
evening grew worse&mdash;heat and thirst excessive&mdash;drank mustard whey on going
to bed, but had a very bad night&mdash;no sleep. much oppressed, severe head-ach,
and pain over my loins.</p>

<p>8th. Took a gentle purge of cream of tartar and manna, which operated,
and gave me some ease. Left off the bark, as it seemed to increase the febrile
symptoms, and drank sage and apple tea, decoction of prunes, tamarinds, &amp;c.
At 10 o’clock in the forenoon a very severe hot fit; heat intense, oppression
in my stomach and breast almost insufferable. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;-, surgeon of the Eagle
cruiser, gave me a most nauseous saline mixture, which vomited and purged
me severely. The quantity of bile which came off my stomach was incredible,
yet, I felt no relief, and the agony of the hot fit continued till 4
o’clock in the afternoon, when it went off by a most profuse perspiration.
During this fit my thirst was constant and intense. In the evening my skin
became dry, the thirst returned, and I had a very bad, sleepless night.</p>

<p>I now began to experience some of the dreadful symptoms which are, I believe,
peculiar to fevers in Turky and Arabia; a sensation of dread and horror,
totally unconnected with the fear of death; for, while the patient is most afflicted
with this symptom, it is for the most part accompanied with a strong
desire to put an end to his existence. The agony from the heat of the body
is beyond conception. I have heard some of my fellow sufferers roar hideously
under the violence of the pain.</p>

<p>9th Till noon tolerably well. About 1 o’clock the hot fit attacked me,
and was full as severe as yesterday; heat and thirst rather greater, and but
little relief for more than an hour after the perspiration commenced. This
attack left me very weak, much exhausted, with cold, weakening sweats,
quick unequal pulse, severe head-ach, confusion, anxiety and incessant thirst;
a sleepless night, startings, anxieties, and a constant wish to terminate my
sufferings by death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span></p>

<p>10th. Forenoon, pretty free from fever. Attacked at the same hour as
yesterday. The fit more violent&mdash;delirium. The agony of the heat not to
be expressed; the whole body as if on fire; unremitting thirst, profuse perspiration,
yet no relief till late in the evening; no sleep, a dreadful night, &amp;c.
Pulse about 120, unequal and fluttering.</p>

<p>A mere relation of facts can give but a faint idea of the wretched situation to
which the factory was now reduced: by this time eleven twelfths of the inhabitants
of Bussorah were taken ill, numbers were daily dying, and the reports from
Bagdad and Diarbekir, of the increasing ravages of the plague, left the survivors
not a ray of hope that they could escape the calamity. On every countenance
pain, sickness and horror were strongly painted; nor were we even left
the comforts of sympathy, as every mind was too much engrossed with its own
sufferings to think of administering consolation to others. Four of us lay under
the portico of one of the squares of the factory, calling out for water in a
frenzy of thirst. We used to snatch it from each other, and to supplicate for
a mouthful with as much fervour as a dying criminal for an hour of further
life.</p>

<p>About this period of the fever my eyes became very weak, and every object
I saw was quite yellow. This effect was most perceptible at night, in
looking at the moon and stars. In the evenings we were sometimes carried
in our cots upon the terrace of the factory for air; but the wind was so heated
by the burning sands of the desert, that we felt it more intolerable than even the
lower apartments. We all remarked that the <i>shemaal</i>, or north winds, which
blew without intermission at that time, greatly increased our heat and thirst.</p>

<p>The daily very evident increase of my fever, and its effects upon others becoming
more fatal and alarming, determined me, while any strength remained,
to embrace the consul’s offer of flying from the seat of infection to Bushire,
in the Ranger cruiser.</p>

<p>11th. After an exceeding bad night I was carried early in the morning on
board the Ranger, and was not very ill until about 9 o’clock, when l felt the
fever coming on, with new and more alarming symptoms&mdash;violent head-ach,
giddiness, dimness of sight, approaching delirium, horror, and a most painful
oppression and burning heat in my stomach.</p>

<p>In despair, and to try to quench the unsufferable heat in my stomach and
bowels, I took a pretty large dose of nitre. The oppression and pain increased;
in my confusion I took a paper of tartar emetic, which immediately began
to operate. From that time, about ten o’clock, till half past two in the
afternoon, I know but little of what passed: I was almost all that time either
distracted with pain, or in a swoon; and had it not been for the extraordinary
care and attention of the commander of the cruiser, who supported me in his
arms, and administered such cordials as I, in the short moments of recollection,
could call for, I have not a doubt but I must have sunk under this attack.
He counted eight times that I fainted, and sometimes an interval of ten minutes
before he could perceive any symptoms of returning life. I was chiefly
supported by wine, hartshorn, and spirits of lavender. About three o’clock I
had recovered my recollection: most copious and continued sweats had carried
off the violence of the fever; but faintings and total privation of strength
and spirits remained upon me till late in the evening, when I became to all appearance,
for a short time, perfectly well. A little strength returned, every
symptom of fever vanished, and my feelings were almost the same as if in perfect
health. Some circumstances having prevented the Ranger’s carrying me
to Bushire, I was taken ashore in the evening. When I was brought to the factory
I had an appetite, and ate some chicken broth for supper. Mr. Ross,
who had hitherto escaped the fever, administered a potion of laudanum, and,
I believe, antimonial wine, on going to rest. I slept pretty well, and awoke refreshed
in the morning. I, however, soon became ill, and at noon I had a severe
attack, which continued three or four hours, and left me greatly weakened, my
skin extremely dry, pulse quick, fluttering and irregular, beating from 100 to
120, with an unquenchable thirst, which no liquids could allay. We had no
acids of any kind, which we had great reason to regret.</p>

<p>I did not know till late in the evening that Mr. Abraham, the vice-consul,
who for some days past had been ill of the same fever, had determined to embark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
in the Eagle cruiser next morning for Bushire, as the only chance of saving
his life; and a conversation which I overheard to this effect, that as I was
so very ill, and no hopes of my recovery, it would be better to leave me to die
at Bussorah, made me still more anxious to fly from the place, although I remember
well I had not the most distant hope that I could live. I had suffered
much at the factory, and in the peevishness of illness I thought (perhaps
unjustly) that my living or dying seemed to be a matter of too little consequence
to those whom in health I had treated with much kindness and affection.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock, as I was lying in my cot, on a terrace adjoining the
stairs from whence the boat was to put off, I was seized with such a fluttering,
palpitation, starting, difficulty of utterance from the swelling of my tongue,
that I lay in momentary expectation of breathing my last. This was, however,
probably the cause of my hearing the preparations for the departure of the
boat. About midnight they were leaving the shore. I could not make myself
heard, and I was too weak to get up without help. I made several efforts,
and at last overset the cot I was lying upon, and brought myself to the
floor, from whence I crawled on my hands and knees to the side of the river.
Humanity pleaded for me, and I was taken into the boat, in a situation of
wretchedness I never can forget. We were, after being several hours on the
Euphrates, carried on board the Eagle, opposite to Margil, a country house
belonging to the factory, a few miles distant from Bussorah.</p>

<p>12th. The day was uncommonly hot, and my fever came upon me about
ten o’clock. The heat was intense. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, a young unexperienced
Frenchman, gave me tamarind water and cream of tartar, which had not a
good effect. I now discerned the first symptom of a cold fit; but it was
slight and of short duration. This day, however, I supported the fever rather
better than usual, and in the evening had a short intermission, and slept
a little during the night. The air on the river was this day cooler and more
refreshing than on shore.</p>

<p>13th. About eleven o’clock had a regular cold shivering fit, succeeded by
a very severe hot fever, which continued till five in the evening, when I was
somewhat relieved by perspiration. This day the agony of the hot fit was
inexpressible, with great pain in my loins, and a constant inclination to make
water, which came from me in drops like blood. I had a very bad, sleepless
night.</p>

<p>14th. By Mr. &mdash;&mdash;’s advice I took a dose of tartar emetic, which not
working, he gave me some ipecacuanha. I brought up a great deal of bile,
but the fever increasing, my sufferings under it were greatly increased by the
operation of the emetic, which worked powerfully both upwards and downwards.
This was a trying day indeed. I can give no idea of what I suffered,
which must have been intolerable, attended with intervals of delirium
and frequently swooning. About five the fever began to abate a little, and
at six Mr. &mdash;&mdash; gave me a small dose of decoction of bark, which seemed
instantly to cause a return of the fever, heat, thirst, anxiety and pain.</p>

<p>My fellow-sufferer, Mr. Abraham, was in violent agony this day; he cried
out repeatedly that a fire was consuming his bowels, and that he was in exquisite
torture. The captain of the cruiser had been complaining; he, Mr.
Abraham and myself lay in the same cabin. About 4 o’clock in the afternoon,
when my pain was excessive, I crawled from my cot, with an intention
to drop myself from a port-hole which was under the captain’s
bed, into the river. I had nearly accomplished my purpose, when the captain
perceived me, and had me carried into my bed. I was not delirious;
and, in spite of all my resolution, the agony I suffered this day made me
repeatedly scream out. One of our seamen died suddenly, and the blood, I
was told, instantly flowed from all parts of his body.</p>

<p>This evening we arrived at Bushire. On our coming to an anchor Mr.
Abraham was immediately carried ashore; but I was too ill to be moved,
and accordingly followed in the morning with Capt. Sheriff, after a very
severe, sleepless night.</p>

<p>The heat was so excessive this day that even the natives we had on board sunk
under it, and many of them were struck down with the sun. By noon nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
could keep the deck; and about this time the vessel ran aground on the bar at
the mouth of the Euphrates, but fortunately beat over, and got into the gulf.
Two more of our people died in the evening; and I should have mentioned that,
in sailing down the river, we saw them throwing many dead bodies from the
vessels which were at anchor below Bussorah, and many boats crowded with
people from the Arabian shore, passing over to Persia.</p>

<p>The Persians at first opposed the landing of our sick, and threatened to burn
the ship; but they were prevailed upon by the company’s agent at Bushire,
a most worthy man, to permit us to come ashore.</p>

<p>15th. I was so weak that it was with difficulty they could carry me ashore
in my cot; my strength was quite gone, and I was helpless as an infant.
Some grapes, water-melon and ice had been got for Mr. Abraham: of the
latter he had eaten freely; I was much pressed to do the same but was afraid
of its increasing my pain, and could hardly be prevailed upon to taste it; I,
however, swallowed a little, but by this time my tongue and throat were so
swelled that I had difficulty in getting any thing down. About 10 o’clock
I was attacked as usual; but I was become so weak, and the fever running
higher than usual, that I appeared in the course of this day, more than once,
to be in the agonies of death; perspiration gave no relief to the violent pain
and oppression I laboured under.</p>

<p>The factory at Bushire is a miserable, wretched mud building, bearing
more resemblance to a stable than a human abode: the few rooms, or rather
cells, are insufferably hot, even to those in health, and the rest of the
building has no cover from the sun. In one of the best of these recesses in
the wall Mr. Abraham and I were placed, and on the same bed, as there was
not room enough for two: our agonies were great, and our cries dreadful.
About 7 o’clock in the evening I perceived my companion in the agonies of
death. The company’s agent, Mr. Beaumont, most humanely afforded him
every assistance in his power; and when every other person was afraid to
come near us, he himself attended, and administered such cordials as he
thought might give us relief. Mr. Abraham died in great pain; and, for
fear of alarming the inhabitants, or rather commandant or sheik of the town,
Mr. Beaumont thought it necessary to conceal his death. It was some time
before the dead body could be removed, which had become very putrid, and
covered with purple spots. I have been since told that immediately after
death a great quantity of blood or bile flowed from him as black as ink, and
so highly offensive as to be smelt at some distance from the factory. Past
midnight we were both removed to the terrace, but, unfortunately for me,
there was only one spot where we could lie, and the smell of the dead body
became intolerable; I was, however, cleaned and put into another bed by
the humane assistance of Mr. Beaumont, who sat by me, and treated me with
uncommon tenderness. I recovered a little, but passed a dreadful night indeed.
I shuddered at the agony which I was to feel on the return of the
sun, and most anxiously wished for death, as the only relief from pain that I
could expect. I was unable at this time to move hand or foot, and at times
could not speak. I told Mr. Beaumont that I thought a gentle dose of physic,
if it could be got down, might alleviate the racking pain in my breast,
stomach, bowels and loins; he accordingly prepared some salts, manna and
tamarinds, and gave it to me in the morning.</p>

<p>16th. At eleven o’clock the violence of the fever came on; I grew delirious,
swooned, and the symptoms of approaching death, I was afterwards told,
grew evident to those around me. My eyes were fixed, my tongue hung from
my mouth, and my face grew quite black. I recovered from this fit about
twelve o’clock, and felt excruciating pain, and a burning suffocating heat.
My stomach and bowels seemed all on fire, my lungs played with the utmost
difficulty, and I felt a pain and sensation about my heart which I cannot describe.
I was unable to move; my servant lifted me; I fell into a swoon for
a few minutes, and, when I came to myself, a great quantity of black putrid
bile flowed from me. Relief was instantaneous, and I slept or swooned till
about 5 o’clock, when I found myself free from fever, and able to speak, my
recollection clear, and my mind perfectly composed, but my body so weak
that I had no power of moving, except one of my hands. They gave me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
some sustenance; I had a little sleep; but about midnight I fell into a situation
which I had all the reason to think indicated the immediate approach of
death. My tongue cleft to my mouth, my extremities were as cold as ice, and
the coldness also appeared to extend up my thigh; my arm was destitute of
pulse, nor was the smallest pulsation of the heart perceptible; I never had my
recollection clearer, or perhaps so clear, in my life. My servant was lying by
my bedside; I was convulsed for some minutes; and, on recovering, I got
out the word <i>boy</i>. Fortunately for me he was not asleep, and heard me; I
then got out the word <i>wine</i>; on which he brought me a glass of claret,
which, with much difficulty, I got down; I felt myself much revived; I reflected
on my situation; and, although I had not the most remote idea of surviving
that night, I recollected that I had some fine powdered bark in my
trunk, and it occurred to me that, if any thing could be done to preserve my
life, it would be that medicine taken in red wine; but, my speech immediately
failing me, I could not direct the servant to give it to me. Death seemed
approaching; coldness had seized all my limbs; my sight became confused,
as I perceived from looking at the stars, which danced before me; and
the rattle or noise in my throat was very perceptible to the servant, as he afterwards
told me. I fainted and continued in a state of insensibility, I believe,
for about an hour. The loud lamentations of the servant, bewailing
his own misfortune in losing his master in a country so remote from his own,
seemed to recall me to life; I felt as if refreshed with a little sleep, and got
out the words <i>bark and wine</i>; it was instantly brought, and the man
gave me two large tea-spoonfuls in a large glass of claret. The effect was
instantaneous, and operated like a charm; the coldness left me, I could speak
intelligibly, and could move my hands. I told the servant to give me a
tea-spoonful of the bark every hour, in a glass of claret. By 8 in the morning
I had taken six doses, and more than half a bottle of claret. I was considerably
strengthened, and could converse with Mr. Beaumont, who encouraged
me to persevere in the bark, and treated me with uncommon attention.
I had been sadly neglected at Bussorah, but this was amply made up to me
by the humane and tender attentions of Mr. Beaumont, who was a great predestinarian,
and who never shunned danger when he felt it a duty to assist a
fellow creature. He waited upon me like a nurse, consoled me under pain
and sickness, and, when my fever was at its greatest height, he has often held
me in his arms, when I wanted to be removed, or my bed shifted. About
this time my legs and thighs became covered with blotches of a dusky brown
hue, some of them as broad as the palm of the hand, quite dry, and they
itched intolerably. At the same time several little boils broke out in different
parts of my body, but there was only one, over my eye, that came to suppuration;
the others, and the eruption on my legs and thighs, all disappeared.</p>

<p>I continued the bark till 12 o’clock, and then left it off till 4, when I took
another dose. The dreadful fever of the preceding days did not return on
this, but I was still extremely ill, had very great difficulty in speaking and
breathing; a swelling also in my throat, parched tongue, and unquenchable
thirst. I had not the most distant hope of living. I tried to take some broth,
but the swelling in my throat prevented my swallowing. I passed a very bad
night, with startings, anxiety, and great pain over the kidnies; and what little
sleep I got seemed to make me worse; I was fatigued with it, and under
the constant dread of suffocation: towards morning my throat grew worse, and
my thirst was excessive.</p>

<p>18th. Left off the bark, uncertain what I ought to do&mdash;no fever, but the
same symptoms as the day before&mdash;drank a little chicken broth, which was
the only sustenance I had taken for four days before&mdash;great oppression and
heat in my stomach and bowels. Mr. Beaumont found out an Armenian who
professed physic. This man gave me a clyster, which gave me great relief,
and a water to drink, famous as a febrifuge among the Persians; I drank of it
freely, and found much benefit from it. But the most extraordinary of all
the symptoms I experienced was this, that, the third day after the first intermission
of my fever, one of my teeth, and one of the nails of my hand,
came out without the smallest pain, only a little swelling in the gum; and, on
the nail falling off some matter flowed from the end of my finger. I never
had the tooth-ach. At this time the boil on my eye suppurated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span></p>

<p>From the 18th of June to the 5th of July, being seventeen days, my fever
did not return. I recovered strength slowly, and could walk a little, supported
by two men. My food was chiefly chicken and veal broth and about
a glass and a half of Madeira wine a day. Yet I had many symptoms of disease
hanging about me&mdash;restless, fatiguing nights&mdash;great thirst&mdash;bad taste in
my mouth: every thing I took seemed bitter and salt&mdash;pains in my back,
sides and loins and great difficulty in making water. In this time I passed
much bile, naturally and by clyster; and I had a purgative from the Armenian,
which weakened me greatly.</p>

<p>The springs lifted, as seamen term it, three days before the change. The
opinion is universal in those countries, and also in India, particularly Bombay,
where intermittents are prevalent, that the change and full of the moon has
an effect upon all intermitting diseases, of which afterwards I had many proofs
in my own case. To prevent a relapse, I took some decoction of bark, but
in too small quantities to answer the purpose.</p>

<p>4th July. My water, from being thick and muddy, became quite clear.</p>

<p>The 5th of July, after dinner, I was taken with a slight hot fit, which continued
about two hours, and then went off by copious perspiration; the remaining
part of the evening I was entirely free from fever.</p>

<p>6th. I took decoction of bark&mdash;no fever.</p>

<p>7th. At 11 o’clock a regular cold and hot fit; the former continued three
quarters of an hour, the latter two hours. Although much less severe than
my former fever, yet I suffered a good deal from the hot fit. Left off the
bark by the advice of the Armenian, who told me that it heated me and made
me worse. Much weakened by this day’s illness; nor did the perspiration
entirely free me from the fever.</p>

<p>8th. Had a clyster thrown up, and early in the morning took a draught
from the Armenian, composed of fine vinegar, sugar, and a country seed infused
over night in water.&mdash;A slight hot fit, but of short continuance.</p>

<p>9th. The draught of yesterday repeated&mdash;at 10 a regular cold and hot fit,
rather less violent than the last.</p>

<p>10th. No fever&mdash;tolerably well.</p>

<p>11th. Between 8 and 9 in the morning a cold and hot fit, much more severe
than the last&mdash;great heat, thirst and oppression&mdash;much weakened. I now
perceived I had got a regular tertian, and determined on the bark, but was
prevailed on by the Armenian not to use it, he promising to cure me in a
day or two. He gave me water-melon and his infusion of vinegar and seeds.</p>

<p>12th. No fever&mdash;find the water-melon to disagree greatly with my stomach.</p>

<p>13th. Had not as yet indulged much hopes of recovery. I felt still, even
in those days previous to this last relapse, many alarming symptoms of disease,
which made me apprehend I could not recover; and this last attack
had again reduced me so low, that it was evident that, unless I could get removed
from those scorching climates, a very short time would put an end to
my life. Except in the humanity and goodness of Mr. Beaumont, I was
without a single comfort or conveniency of life at Bushire. The heat of the
weather seemed daily to increase, and the house we were in hardly covered us
from the direct rays of the sun. My servant was taken ill, and appeared to
be dying: it was with the greatest pleasure, therefore, I received the accounts
this day of the Eagle cruiser having arrived last night from Bussorah, on her
way to Bombay.</p>

<p>At half past seven o’clock I had a very severe fit; the hot fit was uncommonly
violent, and continued about three hours. I was much reduced, and
resolved at all events to take the bark in powder, and in large doses, and to
dismiss the Armenian. In this I was confirmed by Mr. Puget, who informed
me that the few survivors at Bussorah owed their lives entirely to the bark,
which had at last been given in very large doses.</p>

<p>14th. I took four doses, or eight tea-spoonfuls, of powdered bark. It purged
me, and carried off a great quantity of black putrid bile. This evening I
was carried in my cot on board the Eagle, resolved at all events, even if I
had been certain of dying in the boat, to leave Bushire, where I had hardly
shelter from the sun, and where the heat was so excessive, that Capt. Alderson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
of the Eagle and two passengers were taken ill from it last night. I got on
board very late, yet found myself refreshed from the sea air.</p>

<p>15th. The fever did not return. I continued to take the bark as yesterday,
and found myself surprisingly strengthened. I persevered under this course
till the 3d of August, when the vessel arrived at Muscat, and I was astonishingly
recovered for the shortness of the time.</p>

<p>From the 14th of July to the 3d of August I had taken seven ounces of
bark; and as the fever had returned upon me the last day of the springs at
the preceding change of the moon, two days before this change I increased my
daily dose, and continued in this manner till the 4th, when the springs being
over, and perceiving no symptoms of fever remaining, I left off the bark
entirely. I had generally taken six tea-spoonfuls every day.</p>

<p>From the 15th of July till my arrival at Muscat, a seaport on the coast of
Arabia, my recovery was exceedingly rapid. I had a keen appetite, a pretty
good digestion, sound, refreshing sleep, and my daily increase of strength was
very perceptible. My diet, till this time, had been generally chicken broth,
rice and boiled fowl, light pudding, &amp;c. On leaving off the bark I observed
no particular regimen, only abstaining from salted and high-seasoned meats,
and confining myself to three or four glasses of Madeira. I found that an infusion
of prunes, with a small quantity of cream of tartar, was of much service
to me during the course of the bark, as it kept me cool, and my body open.
I was sensible, at times, during my recovery, of a slight but troublesome pain
under my fifth rib on the right side, especially when I lay on that side; but
from feeling and pressing my hand over the region of the liver, and from other
circumstances, I had no reason to suspect that my liver was affected; and, as
it soon left me, the cause was probably trifling or accidental.</p>

<p>On my leaving Muscat a large boil came upon the hip-bone, the size of a
small melon, extending some way up the side, and down the thigh, with a
hard basis. After arriving at Bombay, which we did in fourteen days, it
broke, and in a few days healed up. I shall only add, that at Bombay I was
detained four months before I had an opportunity of proceeding to Europe.
In that time I had three returns of my ague, but on taking a few doses of
bark it left me. Those attacks happened at the change of the moon. From
Bombay to Europe I had three or four slight fits of the ague; the worst on
our making the coast of South Guinea, at the settlement of Benguela, where
we found the wretched remains of a Portuguese garrison, the survivors of a
fatal putrid fever, which, as they told us, raged in those parts for eighteen
months before. The last attack I had was the day we made the Rock of
Lisbon, since which time I have had no returns of the ague, although, when
the wind continues long at east, I am sensible of a tendency to that complaint.</p>

<p>I shall now give a brief account of the fate of my fellow sufferers at Bussorah.
This unfortunate party consisted of capt. Sheriff, of the Eagle cruiser;
Mr. Brown, a Bengal merchant, carrying goods from India to Aleppo; Mr.
Palmer, a gentleman returning with his fortune from Bengal to Europe;
Mr. Robson, surgeon to the factory; Mr. Abraham, the vice-consul; Dr.
Ross, who had practised many years at Constantinople, some time in Bengal,
and was then taking the opportunity of accompanying me across the desert;
Mr. Smith, a merchant from India; and an Italian Carmelite, the vicar of
Bussorah, who came from Bombay. It is unnecessary to say that the <i>seca dab</i>
is a common symptom in the Turkish fever, or, in other words, a strong desire
of self-destruction. We had a fatal instance of it in our party. Mr.
Brown, the second day of his fever, being left alone, got to his pistols, and,
throwing in four or five balls, discharged them into his breast, and was found
dead a few minutes afterwards. I believe every one of us at times would
have done the same, had we been possessed of the means of accomplishing it.
Mr. Robson died the third day of his fever, in great agonies, but perfectly
sensible. His was a continued high fever, without any remission. Mr. Palmer
died the 4th day, under the same symptoms as the preceding. The Carmelite,
the second morning after he was taken ill, had opened a vein in his
arm, and bled to death, most probably intentionally. Captain Sheriff was
seized with the fever on his return from Bussorah to Bushire. He died the
third day, in a manner which is even painful to relate. He was a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
singular strength of constitution, and suffered unusual agonies before he died.
His cries were heard all over the factory; he foamed at the mouth, gnashed
with his teeth, and tore his arms with his teeth. Those who heard him compared
his cries to the bellowing of a mad bull. He was no sooner dead but
his body was covered with purple spots, and so offensive that the people
could hardly carry it out to be buried. Mr. Sheriff’s was what they call the
worst kind of plague.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, formerly mentioned as having escaped the plague at Bussorah
by shutting himself up in a mud house, was seized on his voyage to Bussorah
with a kind of insanity, imagining that people were conspiring against his
life, and that he was capable of overhearing, at a great distance, even a whisper
spoken to his disadvantage. He, however, escaped the infection, and returned
to England in health.</p>

<p class="pl1hi1 fs95"><i>Set of Queries furnished by Doctors</i> <span class="smcap">Aikin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jebb</span>;
<i>and by Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Howard</span> <i>put to several foreign Physicians,
during his tour; with their Opinions concerning the
Plague</i>.</p>


<p>1. Is the infection of the plague frequently received by the French?</p>

<p>Answer, by <i>Raymond</i>, physician at Marseilles: Sometimes it is.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>,
surgeon do: In the lazaretto some have touched infected bodies and
things with impunity. Attributed to the temperament of the body.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>,
physician to the Leghorn lazaretto: The plague cannot be communicated
but by very near approach, or touch: air cannot be the vehicle.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>, physician
to the Malta lazaretto: It may happen that one person may inhabit the
same chamber, or even touch an infected person, with impunity; of which I
have known instances; but all who approach the atmosphere of an infected body
may receive the infection by respiration. Contagion is almost always received
before touching or approaching the infected person.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>, physician at
Venice: Contact is one of the most powerful and dangerous means of communicating
the infection; but for the developement of its effects a predisposition
in the receiving body is necessary.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>, physician at Trieste: It is
most frequently communicated by the touch. It has been given by a flower
held and smelt at, first by two persons who remained free; and then by a
third, who sickened and died in 24 hours.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician at Smyrna: The
infection is in reality communicated by the touch alone; for all who keep
from contact of infected persons or things remain free. To the effect of
contact, however, a certain disposition of the air is necessary; for we often see
infected persons arrive from other countries, yet the disease does not spread.
But what this disposition is can scarcely be conceived. Commonly in this
climate, the disease appears at the end of spring, and continues to the middle
of summer; with this particularity, that, in cloudy weather, and during the
<i>sirocco</i> winds, the attacks are more frequent. Also in the same diathesis of
the air some receive the infection, while others exposed to the same dangers
escape it. From observation it appears, that cachectic persons, and those of
constitutions abounding in acid, do not readily take it. The contagious miasmata
may be dormant in the body for some time without doing the least
harm, till set in motion by sudden fear, or the excessive heat of a bath.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra.
Luigi di Pavia</i>, prior of the hospital of San Antonio at Smyrna: The
plague is communicated by contact, according to all the observations I have
been able to make for eighteen years.</p>

<p>2. Does the plague ever rise spontaneously?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: Incontestible experience shows that it only proceeds from
contact.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>: From all ages the plague has been brought to Marseilles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
by merchandise or persons beyond sea.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>: As the disease
always appears with the same symptoms, it is not probably spontaneous,
but the consequence of a particular contagion.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: Some contagious
fevers come of themselves; others proceed from the communication of contagion.
The plague is thought to have originated in Egypt, and spread itself
from thence.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>: Contagious fevers do not arise of themselves, but
are always the product of a peculiar poison&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>: I know no fever that
can properly be called contagious, and doubt if even the plague can be considered
as such. My reasons are drawn from the very different manner in
which the plague appears in different years, and the different degree in which
it spreads. I therefore conclude that contagious fevers come of themselves.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i>
physician: According to the most ancient authorities, the plague has
always been brought to Smyrna by contagion, and was never produced here.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra.
Luigi</i>: Ancient and common observation in this city prove that the
plague is derived <i>solely</i> from contagion.</p>

<p>3. To what distance is the air infected? How far does actual contact,
wearing infected clothes, or touching other things, produce the disease?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: The infected are safely conversed with across a barrier, which
separates them only a few paces.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>: The air round the patient is
infected more or less according to the degree of poison which exhales. Here
in the lazaretto they are spoken with across two barriers, a few paces from
each other, without fear of contagion. Hence it would appear that the plague
is communicated only by the touch, or still more by wearing infected clothes.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>:
If one speaks of an infected person shut up in an unventilated
chamber, it may be said that the whole chamber is dangerous; but if one
speaks of a patient exposed to the open air, it has been proved that the infection
does not extend beyond five geometrical paces from the body. Beyond
this distance one is in safety. The actual touch of an infected person
or thing is proved to be very dangerous by fatal experience; but to what degree,
is not ascertained.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: The infection extends only some paces; and
the miasms, at the distance of about ten paces, are so corrected by the air as
to lose all their activity. It may be communicated by touching infected
things, especially of a porous nature, as cloth, wool, skins, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>:
From the moment of infection to the time when nature has entirely dissipated
the contagious principle, which usually happens in forty days, there is always
a capacity of communicating the infection. The degree of infection is in
proportion to the volume of air surrounding the patient; the air being what
absorbs, dissipates and communicates the contagious principle. Infected
substances communicate the disease for many years, in proportion to the
ventilation they have undergone, or of which they are susceptible.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician:
The degree of infection in the air about the sick depends upon the
greater or less malignity of the disease, and other circumstances. The air
about poor patients is more infectious than about the rich. These things being
established, I am of opinion that, in the greatest contagion, we may securely
see a patient at the distance of two ells, if the chamber windows be
not all shut.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra. Luigi</i>: The infection is greater or less in proportion to
the virulence of the contagion; but I have made no observation as to the distance.
The disease is communicated by contact of all infected things, and
by close inspiration of the breath of the sick.</p>

<p>4. What are the seasons in which the plague chiefly appears; and what is
the interval between the infection and the disease?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: The plague shows itself at all seasons, but less at the two solstices.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>:
Great ravages may be made in all seasons, but principally
in the greatest heats of summer. From the infection to the disease is two or
three days.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>: The plague appears at all times, in the same manner
as poisons at all times produce their effects. But observations show that
its ravages are greater in hot seasons than in cold; and it seems that summer
and the first months of autumn are most to be dreaded. There is no certainty
as to the interval between the infection and the disease, as it depends on
the particular constitution of the patient.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: Warm, moist seasons contribute
to the production of all infectious diseases. The interval from the
infection to the seizure is various, according to the virulence of the poison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
and the constitution of the patient. Sometimes it acts slowly, sometimes like
a stroke of lightning.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>: The spring is the principal season. Generally
the disease shows itself at the instant of touch, like an electrical shock.
Sometimes a person retains the contagious principle without any sensible effect,
and then unknowingly communicates it to a third, in whom, if predisposed
to the disease, it becomes active; or, otherwise, it may be communicated
to others successively in the same way, till it becomes dissipated and annihilated,
as happened at Smyrna in 1783. In bodies predisposed it very
rarely conceals itself till the third day.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician: Answered in the first.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra
Luigi</i>: The plague is most fatal in Smyrna from April to July; and
it is constantly observed that great colds and heats much diminish it, and copious
dews extinguish it. The infection shows itself in 24 hours, more or less,
according to the difference of temperament.</p>

<p>5. What are the first symptoms of plague? Are they not frequently a swelling
in the glands of the groin and armpit?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: The plague often conceals itself under the form of an inflammatory,
ardent or malignant fever. Tumours of the glands are often its first
symptom.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>: The first symptoms of the plague vary; but the most
common are, buboes in the armpit and groin; parotids and carbuncles in various
parts of the body.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>: The first symptoms are, debility, fever,
excessive thirst, followed by great heat; after which carbuncles or buboes
appear in the armpits, groin and parotids. The groin is sooner attacked than
the armpit.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: Swellings in the armpits and groin are indeed the characteristics
of the plague; yet they are not the sole nor the first symptoms,
and often are not seen at all; as when the plague disguises itself under the
form of other diseases.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>: Glandular swellings are properly the
symptom of the second stage, and are preceded by those febrile symptoms
which are immediately the consequence of receiving the infection; such as
pain in the head, drowsiness, great prostration of strength, dryness of the tongue,
vomiting, hiccough, tremor, diarrhœa.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>: Its first symptoms are relative
to the constitution of the year, and of the body seized, and the place where
it was produced, or whence it came. In 1783 all the parts of Natolia were
infected; and the disease transported to Smyrna, which is the centre, was extinguished
without the loss of a single person. Generally the plague of Constantinople,
transported to Smyrna, does little harm. That of Egypt causes
havock, as in every country. That of the Thebais is always cruel, and, carried
to Lower Egypt, is fatal. The inguinal glands are most generally affected.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i>
physician: The swelling of the glands is seldom the first symptom.
Patients are every day seen who, being supposed ill of another disorder,
in two, three or more days show glandular swellings, or carbuncles, by
which the plague is manifested. On the contrary, many, who from the usual
signs are supposed to have the plague, become well in a day or two, without
any external swelling. The first symptoms are, horripilation, or actual shivering,
nausea or vomiting, loss of strength, and fever. These are common to
many diseases; but the pathognomic signs are, a difference in the pulsations of
the two sides, with this circumstance, that from the diversity a prognostic arises;
it having been observed that if the pulse on the side of the tumour or
carbuncle be greater or more frequent, it bodes well; whereas, if it be smaller,
it shows greater malignity, and more is to be feared. Further, there is observed
among the first symptoms a visible pulsation in the carotids, greatest on
the affected side; and also a crystalline vivacity in the eyes, with a kind of
contraction or diminution of the eye on the affected side.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra. Luigi</i>: The
most remarkable symptoms of the plague are, turbidness and sparkling of the
eyes, the tongue furred with a white mucus, and very red at its tip, frequent
biting of the lips, violent pain in the head, and inability to hold it up; a sense
of great cold in the loins, vomiting, debility. Swellings of the glands are not
among the first symptoms.</p>

<p>6. Is it true that there are two distinct fevers with nearly the same symptoms,
one of which is properly termed the plague, and is communicated from
a distance by the air, and without contact; while the other, which is properly
termed contagion, is only communicated by the touch, or at least by near
approach to infected persons or things?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span></p>

<p><i>Morandi</i>: It is certain, from multiplied observations, that there are two
sorts of pestilential fevers, similar in appearance; one of which proceeds from
the contamination of the air alone, and is communicable to any distance; the
other is produced alone by contact, or near approach. The former of these is
properly termed a pestilential fever, the latter a contagious one.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>:
The distinction of these fevers is useless; since the same which is communicated
by the touch, is that also conveyed by the air to a certain distance, especially
in a close place.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician: That there are two kinds of plague
is absolutely to be denied; yet sometimes it happens that persons are attacked
with the plague without knowing from whence it came.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra. Luigi</i>: I hold
it for certain that there is only one species of plague, though differing in malignity.</p>

<p>7. What is the method of treatment in the first stage; what in the more
advanced periods? What is known concerning bark, snakeroot, opium, wine,
pure air, the application of cold water?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: The disease is treated as inflammatory. No specific has been
discovered for it.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>: At the beginning, bleeding, vomiting, purgatives,
diluents, refrigerants and antiseptics are used; afterwards antiseptics
and cordials, relatively to the temperament and symptoms&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>: The
plague causing always a disposition to inflammation and putrefaction, it is always
proper to bleed proportionally to the strength, and to use a cooling regimen,
with the vegetable acids. The repeated use of emetics is also proper,
both to clean the first passages, and to dispose the virus to pass off by the skin.
In the progress it is necessary to favour the evacuation of the virus by that
issue which nature seems to point at. Thus either antiphlogistic purgatives
are given, if nature points that way, or suppurative plasters are to be applied
to any tumours which may appear. Epispastics to the extremities are proper
where nature wants rousing. The vitriolic acid in large doses has been found
very serviceable in the plague at Moscow, attended with carbuncles. When
the inflammation is over, and marks of suppuration appear, the bark, with
wine and other cordials, is proper. The surgeon’s assistance is proper in the
treatment of boils and anthraces, which last are seldom cured without the actual
cautery.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: In the beginning of pestilential fevers bleeding is sometimes
proper, and vomits almost always. In their progress frequent subacid
and cold drinks, the bark given liberally, and vitriolic acid, have been found
powerful remedies when there was a dissolution of the blood&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>: In
the first period, evacuations, according to the particular circumstances of the
case, are proper: in the second, bark mixed with wine, and opium as a temporary
sedative. Pure air is very necessary; and fire as a corrective, with the
burning of antiseptic and aromatic substances.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>: As soon as a Christian
finds he has got the plague, he eats caviare, garlic and pork; drinks
brandy, vinegar and the like, to raise the buboes. Upon these he applies
greasy wool, caviare, honey of roses, dried figs, &amp;c. to bring them to suppuration.
The Turks and Arabs drink bezoar in powder with milk, and other
sudorifics, in order to expel the virus. They vomit, and possibly a second
time. At Cairo they take opium, and cover themselves with mattresses in
order to excite sweat; and, though parched with heat and thirst, they drink
nothing. They open the immature buboes with a red hot iron. At Constantinople
and Smyrna they eat nothing, and drink much water and lemonade.
The Jews drink a decoction of citron seeds, lemon or Seville orange peel, and
their own urine. They abstain scrupulously from animal food. In 1700 a
physician in Smyrna found bleeding very useful. Another, in another year,
cured the plague by bleeding, and an antiphlogistic regimen. My brother in
Cairo treated it like a biliary fever, with vomits, saponaceous attenuants,
and antiphlogistics; and successfully. Some sailors at Constantinople in the
frenzy of the plague have thrown themselves into the sea; and it is said
that on being taken out of it they have recovered. My opinion upon the
whole is, that the treatment ought to be relative to the constitution of the year,
and of the patient, by which the nature of the disease itself is greatly altered.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i>
physician: Bleeding in many cases may be serviceable, as I have known
patients, who were bled by mistake, recover; and others recovered from a
most desperate condition by a spontaneous hemorrhage. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
persons have been apparently injured by both these circumstances. The
difference of effect seems to depend on the state of the blood, whether it be
disposed to coagulation or dissolution. In the former, bleeding is useful, in
the latter, hurtful. Vomits, according to my experience, have not succeeded;
yet I should not hesitate to try ipecacuanha in substance, exhibiting half a
scruple at two or three times, in the expectation that in this manner it would
not run down. Bark may be useful in dissolutions of the blood; and also
small doses of opium, and other medicines prudently administered. In excessive
watchfulness I have known relief procured by anointing the temples
with ung. populeon. In a case of hiccough the liquor anod. miner. Hoffmanni
succeeded with one. The Turks, in the violence of the fever, take
handfuls of snow, and apply it all over their bodies, and also eat it; and
sometimes throw cold water on their feet. But whether this is of service or
not cannot be determined; as these people in other respects pay no regard to
rules of diet.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra. Luigi</i>: They who practise empirically in the plague use
none of the recited methods, but only strong sudorifics, and ventilation of the
air; and complete the cure by proper treatment of the sores by suppuration.</p>

<p>8. When the plague prevails, do the physicians prescribe to those who have
the disorder a more generous, or a more abstemious diet? and do they prescribe
any thing to the uninfected?</p>

<p><i>Jew</i> physician: In times of the plague, many are accustomed to eat no
flesh; others, no fish; but I know not whether by the advice of physicians.
For myself, I have been in many plague years, but have made no alteration in
the management of myself.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra Luigi</i>: In Smyrna the plague is generally
treated with a rigorous diet. They only use rice and vermicelli boiled in water;
and sometimes, when the patient is too costive, juices and herbs boiled without
seasoning. From time to time they give some acid preserves, and raisins, and,
in great heats, some slender lemonade; and a dish of good coffee with a biscuit
every day. For drink they only use toast and water; and they follow this abstemious
regimen till the fortieth day of the disease is completed, after which
they take chicken broth, lamb, and other food of easy digestion.</p>

<p>9. Are convalescents subject to repeated attacks from the same infection?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: Not unless they touch something infected.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>: Convalescents
are sent to fumigated chambers, and there is no instance of relapse.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>:
No instance of relapse, after being well recovered from the
first attack, have come to my knowledge; but they are liable to fall into other
disorders, such as consumption, hæmoptoe, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: Convalescents are
without doubt liable to a relapse, and authors are full of instances of it. In
the plague of Messina M. Cotogno says that a man had successively fourteen
buboes, and was cured at last.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>: All convalescents may relapse.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>:
They have it not twice in the same year&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician: Convalescents
are often attacked anew, and die; but this does not usually happen
from a fresh infection taken elsewere, but from some remains of their own
contagion, excited by intemperance in food, or the venereal act.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fra. Luigi</i>:
From irregularities in eating and drinking, bodily fatigues, affections of the
mind, especially anger, they are liable to repeated and very dangerous relapses.</p>

<p>10. What is the proportion of deaths, and the usual length of the disease?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: The mortality is different in different seasons and years.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Demollins</i>:
In the plague of Marseilles in 1720, half the inhabitants perished.
The usual length of the disease is that of other acute disorders; but longer
when the tumours come to suppurate.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>: The proportion of
deaths is variable and uncertain. As to duration, when the disease is very
acute and fatal, the patient generally dies within five days from the first invasion
of the fever, or first marks of the plague. When he recovers, no certain
termination can be assigned. If the time of healing all the sores be
reckoned, it may be to three, four or five months, or more.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: The
mortality is very various. Of ten whom I treated in the lazaretto, three
died. I have observed that the fever generally runs on to twenty or twenty-one
days.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>: The bills of mortality in places visited by the plague
usually amount to thirty per cent, sometimes to fifty. (He seems to mean of
the whole number of inhabitants.)&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>: The proportion of deaths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
varies infinitely. It has been observed that the Jews in Constantinople and
Smyrna lose only one third; which is attributed to the care they take of
their sick. At Cairo, on the other hand, they are the first attacked and lose
more than three fourths. The Turks lose two thirds; other nations a little
more or less. Europeans in Cairo lose five sixths. Sometimes it kills immediately;
sometimes in twenty-four hours; commonly in three days. When
the patient gets over the ninth day there are great hopes of recovery, as the
buboes are then suppurated. They may, however, die within the fortieth
day, especially if they commit any irregularity, the principal of which is eating
flesh, which instantly causes a return of fever, and death. It never passes
beyond the fortieth day.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician: The mortality is various, as also
the duration: some in two, three or four days; some hold out six, eight, or
more&mdash;-<i>Fra. Luigi</i>: Generally more die than survive; but in our hospital of
San Antonio of Smyrna, from the care taken of the sick, the number recovering
has, for eighteen years past, exceeded that of the dead.</p>

<p>II. What are the means to prevent the plague, to stop its contagion, and
to purify infested places?</p>

<p><i>Raymond</i>: There is no other method of preserving one’s self from the
plague, than avoiding the contact of infested things. Goods are purified by
exposing them to the open air for forty days; and furniture by a strong fumigation
with aromatics and sulphur.&mdash;-<i>Demollins</i>: Here, in the lazaretto, infected
goods and furniture are exposed to a current of air for forty days. The
air of infested places is purified by burning all sorts of aromatics.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Giovanelli</i>:
The method of prevention is, to avoid all communication with infected
persons or goods. The means of stopping the contagion form a body of
police, too extensive to be here mentioned.&mdash;&mdash;<i>They</i>: The means of prevention,
besides avoiding infected things and persons, are sobriety in living, the use of
vinegar internally and externally, and an issue. Infected places are purified
by fumigation and ventilation, by scraping the lime from the walls, (which
is then thrown into the sea) and whitewashing them anew with lime and sea-water,
by washing the floors, windows, doors, &amp;c. first with sea-water, and
then with vinegar, taking great care to leave nothing that is infested. The
bodies of the dead are buried in a place set apart for that purpose; and their
beds and bedding are burned. As to other things not used during the illness,
the linen is washed with soap and ley; the woollen clothes are put into
sea-water for two days, and then ventilated for twenty days. Those which
would be spoiled by water are hung on a line in the air for 40 days, and fumigated
from time to time according to their quality&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morandi</i>: A fire is to
be kept constantly in the sick chamber in all seasons. All fæces, &amp;c. are to
be immediately removed. Clean sheets and shirts daily. The healthy must
avoid commerce with the infected; must purge gently now and then, smoke
tobacco, drink pure wine medicated with wormwood, gentian, zedoary, &amp;c.
and avoid fear and other passions, and excess of all kinds.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jew</i> physician:
No means of prevention are used in the Turkish dominions.&mdash;-<i>Fra. Luigi</i>:
Fire, water and air are used for stopping the contagion, and purifying places.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Verdoni</i>:
The best preservatives are supposed to be sprinkling the room with
vinegar and perfumes, ventilation and fumigation. The Greeks in Smyrna during
lent, when they eat only vegetables, are seldom attacked; while among
those who eat flesh the contagion makes great havock. Hence the best means
of prevention are to eat moderately, and not at all of animal food; to drink
water and vinegar; to sprinkle the chamber with the latter; and use frequent
ventilation; to change the clothes, especially the linen, daily; hanging in the
air such as has been used, for 15 or 20 days. For suppressing the infection
every thing is to be washed that can undergo the operation, and the walls of
the chamber to be whitened with lime, but after the 24th of June no further
care is taken.</p>

Thus Dr. Hodges; but Calmet informs us, that the Hebrews call by the
name of plagues all diseases sent by way of punishment or correction from
God; as the pestilence, infection, the leprosy, sudden deaths, famines, tempests:
in a word, all calamities, whether public or private. <i>Calmet’s Dict.</i>
vol.&nbsp;ii. fol. 412. <i>Plaga.</i></p>

<p>Parkhurst derives the Greek term <i>loimos</i>, either from <i>luo</i>, as above, or from
another Greek word signifying <i>to faint</i>; the same from which the English
word <i>eclipse</i> has its origin; or it may be from the Hebrew <i>lehem</i>, to consume.</p>

<p>A friend observes, that “we no where find the word <i>perdition</i> in our version
of the Old Testament. We have, however, the word <i>destruction</i>, which
is of a similar import; as, for instance, in Prov. xv. 11. where the Hebrew
is <i>abdun</i>. In Rev. xvii. 8 &amp; 11, we find the English word <i>perdition</i>; but as
we have no Hebrew version of the New Testament, we may advert to the
ancient Syriac version. The Syriac being a sister dialect of the Hebrew, differs,
radically, but little from it. The Syriac of the two places referred to
above is <i>abdna</i>; hence the word <i>abaddon</i>, whole root is <i>abd</i>, and is the same
with that of the Hebrew word above.</p>

<p>“As to the word <i>plague</i>, we often find it in the Old Testament, but perhaps
never in that specific sense in which the moderns use it. The original
word, rendered plague, is pretty generally <i>ngp</i>, or its derivations; as Exod.
xii. 13., ii. Sam. xxiv. 21, &amp;c.” On this last occasion, however, as the word
<i>pestilence</i> had been used before, in the same chapter, we can scarce doubt
its having been really some kind of disease: and we know that modern
plagues will sometimes destroy as quickly as this is said to have done.</p>

Mr. Gibbon, agreeably to the subject on which he writes, particularises
the mode of vengeance; saying, “the <i>earth frequently swallows up</i> the assassin,”
&amp;c. It is hoped the substitution of the word <i>vengeance</i>, in general,
will not be deemed a material alteration.</p>

Gibbon’s Hist. vol. iv. Procopius, in speaking of the numbers who died
in this extraordinary plague, compares them to the sand of the sea; and afterwards
expresses them by a phrase which has been translated <i>two hundred
millions</i>. The phrase is <i>myriadas myriadon myrias</i>. Mr. Gibbon, by dropping
the first word, restricts the sense to <i>one hundred millions</i>; which he
thinks not wholly inadmissible; but the probability seems to be, that Procopius
did not mean to specify the number, but to represent it as incalculable.
This is done by putting a comma, or semicolon, after the first word; and we
may then read, that there perished <i>myriads; a myriad of myriads</i>. The grammar
is rectified by reading <i>myriades</i> instead of <i>myriadae</i>.</p>

An English gentleman, who resided in Bassorah at that time, preserved
himself from the infection by retiring to a mud-house, where he had no
communication with the inhabitants. Having a large quantity of Bengal
cotton, he sold it to the people to wrap their dead in. The price was put in
a basket, which he hauled up by a rope to his ware-room; lowering it again
with the proportionate quantity of cloth. In the course of the summer he
had an account of <i>seventy thousand</i> winding sheets thus disposed of!</p>

M. Millot places this account among the “exaggerations which ought not
to have a place in history;” but, as we have no evidence for or against the fact,
it was thought proper to let it remain as related by the historians of those
times. It is certain that in those days mankind assembled for the purposes
of bloodshed and slaughter in prodigious numbers; the destruction was commonly
in proportion to the numbers assembled. The account is not more incredible
than that of Tamerlane’s filling up the harbour of Smyrna by
causing each of his soldiers to throw a stone into it. Such an army could
have spared the number in question.</p>

That such accounts are not to be looked upon as entirely fabulous, may be
gathered from what is related by Mr. Thomson in his travels through Palestine,
viz. that on the brink of the lake Asphaltites he found numbers of
“small <i>black pebbles</i>, which are soon set on fire by being held in the
flame of a candle, and yield a smoke intolerably stinking and offensive; but
have this remarkable property, that by burning they lose nothing of their
weight, nor suffer any diminution in their bulk. They are capable of taking
as fine a polish as black marble, and are likewise said to be met with of considerable
size in the neighbouring mountains.”</p>

“<i>Symptom</i> (says Dr. Fordyce) is the Greek name for <i>appearance</i>:” but,
from the strict etymology of the word, it ought rather to be translated <i>accident</i>.

produced in the human body by any distemper whatever.</p>

Dr. Anthony Fothergill, in his prize dissertation upon the suspension of
vital action, quotes some experiments of Dr. Kite, in which he was able to
restore to life animals that had been immersed in water for eight, ten or
twelve minutes, though he acknowledges that this operation, though performed
with great attention, often failed; while other animals, that had been
longer immersed, recovered spontaneously. He further adds, that if it be not
attempted before the convulsions of the animal cease, which on an average of
many experiments happens in about eleven minutes and a half, it will not be
sufficient to renew the vital motions. But, “among the human species
(says Dr. Fothergill) there are not wanting well authenticated instances of
spontaneous recovery at an incomparably longer interval, and after every external
mark of life had disappeared. Such is the latent energy of the heart,
that it sometimes, after remaining several hours quiescent, renews on a sudden
the secret springs of life, surmounts the barriers of the resisting blood, and
restores circulation with all the other functions. Hence the unexpected recoveries
from death-like syncope brought on by sudden terror, or great effusions
of blood, even after the funeral obsequies have been prepared. Hence
some persons have accidentally been brought to life, even after interment, by
the rude motion produced in sacrilegious attempts to wrest rings or bracelets
from the apparently dead body.”</p>

<p>Several surprising instances of the recovery of persons supposed to be dead,
even of the plague, are given by Fabricius Hildanus; to one of which Dr. Fothergill
seems to allude in the above quotation. Hildanus relates, that in the year
1357, when the plague raged violently at Cologne, a certain noble lady, by
name <i>Reichmuth Adoleh</i>, being seized with the disease, was thought to have
died, and was buried accordingly. Her husband, out of affection, would not
take off her wedding ring, which she happened to have on her finger. The
undertakers being acquainted with this circumstance, next night came to the
church where she was buried, opened the sepulchre, and prepared to take off
the ring; when to their utter astonishment she began to raise herself up in the
coffin. Struck with consternation they fled in the utmost haste, leaving to the
fortunate lady the lantern with which they lighted themselves to the church,
and by means of which she now found out where she was, and after being
come to herself, returned to her own house. Here being known by her voice,
and the ring she wore, she found admittance, and by means of a generous diet
gradually regained her health; bringing her husband afterwards three children,
and surviving the accident many years.</p>

<p>A second instance no less remarkable is of a woman of the name of <i>Nicolle
Lentille</i>, who, being supposed dead of the plague, had been thrown into a
pit with a great number of the bodies of others, dead of the same distemper.
After lying there a whole night, she came to herself in the morning, but
neither knew at first where she was, nor, when she did, could she find any
means of escaping, or extricating herself from the heap of dead bodies with
which she was oppressed. Being at a distance from any house, her cries were
of no avail, and, in the mean time, having taken no nourishment for four
days, she was so tormented with hunger that she eat part of the cloth which
covered her face. At last, after remaining twenty-four hours in this dreadful
situation, the pit being opened to bury some other person, she exerted her utmost
endeavours in calling for assistance, and at last was heard by those who
stood round. Being taken up and brought home, she presently recovered, and
lived several years after.</p>

<p>A third example is given by our author of one who, being carried to a church
to be buried, had his face previously sprinkled with holy water by a priest.
But this was no sooner done than he shuddered and opened his eyes in a
fright; on which he was carried home, recovered, and lived eight years after.
Other examples might be brought, but these are sufficient to show what dreadful
accidents may ensue from early burials, and how cautious people ought to
be in consigning their friends and relations to the dust from whence they
were taken.</p>

Dr. Gardiner, in his observations above quoted, gives the following curious
anecdote. “An unmarried lady, of a healthy constitution, has such a
peculiarity in the structure of her nerves, that, though she can, in general,
bear strong odours as well as most people, yet she cannot suffer a rose to be in
her bosom, or to hold it in her hand a few minutes, without becoming
faint, and having an inclination to vomit. Conserve of roses, rose-water,
and similar articles made from roses, have more powerful effects upon her,
and usually excite vomiting. Going into a room where any of her companions
are washing with rose-water, never fails to produce this effect; nor
does she recover of her indisposition in less than two hours.”</p>

The discoveries of modern chemists have determined that the aerial fluid,
termed <i>fixed air</i> or <i>carbonic acid</i>, and which is nearly the same with the vapour
arising from fermenting liquor, and is also largely contained in the fume
of burning charcoal, is not a simple but a compound substance; one part consisting
of the pure part of the atmosphere, or <i>oxygene</i>, the other of real charcoal.
The proportions, according to M. Chaptal, are 12,0288 parts of charcoal
to 56,687 of oxygen.</p>

But there is a still more egregious blunder, and this the more surprising
as it has been very general among physiologists, viz. that when an artery
branches into two the capacity of the branches taken together is greater than
that of the trunk. This would make the whole arterial system one continued
<i>aneurism</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> and, instead of promoting the circulation of the blood, would in
the most effectual manner prevent it. In what manner an error so extraordinary
in its nature could pass the mathematical physicians of the last century,
I cannot imagine; but certain it is, that, in the year 1780 or 1781, the Edinburgh
College were schooled on this subject by one of their own students
named <i>John Theodore Vander Kemp</i>, a Dutchman. This gentleman found,
by accurate mensuration, that when an artery divides, if the diameters of the
two branches are made the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle, the
diameter of the trunk will be the hypothenuse; and thus, as the areas of circles
are to one another in proportion to the squares of their diameters, the sum
of the areas of the two branches will be equal to the area of the trunk. On
looking into Blumenbach’s physiology, I find the same remark.</p>

The vampire is a kind of bat, of a very large size, met with in some
parts of South America and in the East Indies. This vile creature delights
in human blood, and often attacks people in the night time in the most insidious
manner. A late traveller relates that at Surinam he was bit by one of
them, which sucked so much of his blood that in the morning he found himself
exceedingly weak and faint. He felt no pain, nor was sensible of the
injury in any other way. The vampire commonly attacks the great toe,
making a wound so exceedingly small that the person is not awaked by it;
it then sucks till gorged with blood, and, lest the patient should awake, it
keeps fanning him all the while with its large wings, the coolness of which,
in that hot climate, promotes sleep. In this manner some are said to have
been destroyed. Captain Cook relates an humourous anecdote of one of his
sailors, who being ashore at New Holland, and having wandered a little way
into the woods, returned in a fright, crying out that he had seen <i>the devil</i>!
Being asked in what shape Satan had appeared, he answered, “He was about
the size of a <i>one gallon keg</i>, and very like it; and if I had not been <i>afear’d</i>,
I might have touched him.” It was a vampire. The man, notwithstanding
his fright, had not exaggerated its magnitude. People, though mistaken and
terrified, are not to be disbelieved in every part of their relation.</p>

Many fabulous stories have been related concerning the samiel. Even
so late a traveller as Mr. Ives has adopted some of those exaggerated accounts
which have been discredited by those who have long resided in the countries
where this wind is commonly met with. It is not peculiar to the deserts
of Arabia, but is met with in all hot countries which are destitute of
water. In the African deserts therefore it is common; and Mr. Bruce describes
it by the name of <i>simoom</i>. It was preceded by whirlwinds of a very
extraordinary kind. “In that vast expanse of desert (says he) from W.
and to N.&nbsp;W. of us, we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different
distances, at times moving with great celerity, at others walking on
with a majestic slowness. At intervals we thought they were coming in a
very few minutes to overwhelm us; and small quantities of sand did actually
more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out
of sight; their tops reaching to the very clouds.* There the tops often separated
from the bodies; and these, once disjoined, dispersed in the air,
and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken near the middle,
as if struck with a large cannon shot. About noon they began to advance
with considerable swiftness upon us, the wind being very strong at north.
Eleven of them ranged along side of us at about the distance of three
miles. The largest of them appeared to me at that distance to be about
ten feet diameter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was in vain to think of flying; the swiftest
horse or the fasted sailing ship could be of no use to carry us out of this
danger; and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where
I stood.” At another time he saw them in much greater number, but of
smaller size. They began immediately after sunrise, like a thick wood,
and almost darkened the sun. His rays darting through them gave them
the appearance of pillars of fire. They now approached to the distance of
two miles from our travellers. At another time they appeared beautifully
spangled with stars. in Darwin’s Botanic Garden we find a reason assigned
for the appearance of these whirlwinds; viz. the impulse of the wind on a
long ledge of broken rocks which bound the desert. By these the currents of
air which struck their sides were bent and were thus like eddies in a stream
of water which falls against oblique obstacles. In the same work we have
the following poetical description of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Now o’er their heads the whizzing whirlwinds breathe,<br />
And the live desert pants and heaves beneath;<br />
Ting’d by the crimson sun, vast columns rise<br />
Of eddying sands, and war amid the skies,<br />
In red arcades the billowy plains surround,<br />
And whirling turrets stalk along the ground.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="pl1">* <i>N.&nbsp;B.</i> In these sandy deserts, where it never rains, there are no clouds.</p>

<p>Whether the simoom is always preceded by these whirlwinds we know not;
but Mr. Bruce mentions an extreme redness of the air, pointed out by his attendant
Idris, as the sure presage. His advice was, that all of them, upon the
approach of the pernicious blast, should fall upon their faces, with their
mouths on the earth, and hold their breath as long as possible, so that they
might not inhale the deadly vapour. They soon had occasion to follow this
advice; for next day Idris called out to them to fall upon their faces, for the
simoom was coming. “I saw (says Mr. Bruce) from the S.&nbsp;E. a haze coming,
in colour like the purple part of the rainbow, but not so compressed or
thick. It did not occupy twenty yards in breadth, and was about twelve
feet high from the ground. It was a kind of blush upon the air, and it
moved very rapidly; for I could scarce turn to fall upon the ground, with
my face to the northward, when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon
my face. We all lay flat on the ground, as if dead, till Idris told us it
was blown over. The meteor, or purple haze, which I saw, was indeed
passed; but the light air that still blew was of heat sufficient to threaten
suffocation. For my part, I felt distinctly in my breast that I had imbibed
a part of it; nor was I free of an asthmatic sensation till I had been some
months in Italy, at the baths of Poretta, near two years afterwards.” It
continued to blow for some time, and in such a manner as entirely to exhaust
them, though scarcely sufficient to raise a leaf from the ground.</p>

<p>The account given by Mr. Ives is, that it blows over the desert (of Syria) in
the months of July and August, from the northwest quarter, and sometimes
continues with all its violence to the very gates of Bagdad but never affects
any body within its walls. Some years it does not blow at all and in others
it comes six, eight, or ten times, but seldom continues more than a few minutes
at a time. It often passes with the apparent quickness of lightning.
The sign of its approach is a thick haze, which appears like a cloud of dust
rising out of the horizon, on which they throw themselves with their faces on
the ground, as already mentioned. Camels are said, instinctively, to bury
their noses in the sand. As for the stories of its dissolving the cohesion of the
body in such a manner that a leg or an arm may be pulled away from those
who are killed by it, or that their bodies are reduced to a gelatinous substance,
we cannot by any means give credit to them. From its extreme quickness,
and luminous appearance, it would seem to be an electrical phenomenon immediately
preceding those vehement hot winds which all travellers agree in
likening to the vapour issuing from a large oven when the bread is newly taken
out. Its electrical nature will be more probable from the account given
by Mr. Ives, that the Arabians say it always leaves behind it a very sulphureous
smell. These particulars do not at all accord with the supposition of
its consisting of fixed air. I have indeed been assured by a gentleman long
in the service of the English East India Company, that the samiel cannot pass
over a river. Hence probably it has been supposed to be a blast of fixed air,
because this species of gas is readily absorbed by water; but we know that
the same thing would also take place with any quantity of electric matter;
for water takes up this also much more completely than it does fixed air.</p>

<p>The <i>mofetes</i> are invisible, and kill in an instant. They rise from old volcanic
lavas, and, as it were, creep on the ground, and enter into houses, so that
they are very dangerous; but, though they may probably consist of fixed air,
we have not as yet any direct proof of it. It is not indeed easy to imagine
why any lava should suddenly emit a great quantity of fixed air, and then
as suddenly cease; nor in what manner the air thus emitted should continue
unmixed with the atmosphere; for fixed air will very readily mix in this
manner, insomuch that a large quantity of it being let loose in a room has
been found to vanish entirely in less than half an hour. Sir William Hamilton
mentions a mofete having got into the palace of the king of Naples.</p>

Here it is necessary to observe, for the sake of accuracy and perspicuity,
that, in the new chemistry, the terms of which are now very generally adopted,
the words <i>oxygen</i> and <i>hydrogen</i> when mentioned by themselves are not understood
to signify any kind of air, but what I have called the condensable part
of the air. If the word <i>air</i> is added, then the whole substance of the fluid
is understood. But though this is the strict orthodox language of the new
chemistry, it is impossible to say whether every one who adopts the terms be
sufficiently careful in this respect. Indeed this is one out of many inconveniences
that might be pointed out which have arisen from this nomenclature;
for thus the mere omission of a monosyllable, which may happen in
numberless instances, totally perverts the meaning of the author, and may
of course subject him to unmerited censure. Besides, it is not to be known,
unless the author tells us so, that he designs to observe this strictness, and
of consequence we must in multitudes of cases be uncertain of the meaning of
what we read. Thus, in the present instance, when Dr. Girtanner speaks of <i>oxygen</i>,
we know not certainly whether he means the air in substance, or only one of
its component parts. Probably he means the condensable or solid part. If he
does so, there must be a very material difference between his theory and that laid
down in the Encyclopædia, and which is supported throughout this treatise.
In the latter it is maintained that the condensable part is thrown out by the
breath, being previously converted into fixed air, while the elastic part enters
the vital fluid, communicating to it not only the red colour, but heat, and the
principles of life and sensation, as will be more fully explained in the sequel.</p>

<i>Hydrogen</i> air is the same with that by Dr. Priestley called <i>inflammable</i>
air. He also discovered the true composition of it. Having included a few
grains of charcoal in the receiver of an air-pump, and exhausted the air, he
heated it in vacuo by means of a large burning glass. The charcoal was
entirely volatilized and converted into this kind of air. He found, however,
that without some small portion of moisture this volatilization did not take
place.</p>

It is now acknowledged that common atmospherical air contains a portion
of what Dr. Black and Dr. Priestley have called fixed air; but this portion is
so small (not more than one fiftieth part, according to Dr. Anthony Fothergill’s
Prize Dissertation, and <i>none at all</i>, according to Dr. Beddoes) I say, this
proportion is so small, that we cannot suppose it to constitute the quantity of
fixed air thrown out by the breath, which is very considerable. Besides, fixed
air, of all others, is the most readily absorbed; and, indeed, if we could admit
of absorption of any basis of air in the present case, it certainly ought to be
that of fixed air; but where such a quantity is thrown out, we cannot well
admit of any absorption.</p>

In one of Dr. Priestley’s papers above quoted he says, that <i>charcoal</i> is entirely
of <i>vegetable</i> origin; but the conversion of vegetable into animal matter
which we daily see is an undoubted proof that there cannot be any essential
difference between them. Even the bones are undoubtedly produced
from vegetables in such animals as feed upon vegetable substances; so that
even the calcareous earth they contain is plainly of vegetable origin. We may
say indeed that the calcareous particles had a previous existence in the vegetables
used by the animal as food; but we may say the same of the particles
of the blood, flesh, horns, &amp;c. Besides, Dr. Priestley has shown that <i>every</i>
particle of charcoal may be volatilized into inflammable air, with as great accuracy
as any human experiment can be made; so that in this case the calcareous
particles, if any such there were, showed themselves to be as much
charcoal as the rest. In the 74th volume of the Philosophical Transactions,
Mr. Watt has shown, that dephlogisticated spirit of nitre may be changed into
the smoking and phlogisticated kind by means of red-lead or magnesia alba,
as well as by charcoal; of consequence there can be no essential difference
even there. In short, so wonderful and multifarious are the transforming or
metamorphosing powers of nature, that every attempt to find out a substance
upon which these powers cannot act, will be found altogether vain, and
our best conducted and most plausible experiments, made with a view to discover
the ultimate composition or what we call the elements of bodies, will be
found mere inaccuracy, bungling and blunder.</p>

Though the writer of this Treatise was not at that time on the spot
where this event took place, yet he has as good evidence as any one can have
of what has not fallen under his immediate inspection, that these graves were
opened, that the father of one of the young men died; and the mother of
another, and one of the young men himself was taken ill with the eruption of
boils on some parts of his body; but whether there was any person previously
affected with fever in the neighbourhood from whom it might have been derived,
or any thing which might have strongly predisposed those people to it,
is unknown. It is indeed no easy matter to discover who was the first person
affected with an epidemic, as no body chooses to own that either they, or
any of their relatives were the authors of mischief, however involuntary, to the
community. M. Chaptal, however, in his Elements of Chemistry, has some
curious, as well as useful observations on the propriety of burying bodies in a
sufficient space and at a sufficient depth; and on the accidents which may
arise from opening vaults and burying grounds. An instance of this he gives
of the ground of a church in Paris being dug up, which emitted a nauseous
vapour, affecting several people in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>From M. Chaptal’s observations it appears, that bodies do not soon dissolve
in such a manner as to emit no disagreeable or noxious effluvia, when buried.
M. Becher, he says, “had the courage to make observations during the course
of a year upon the decomposition of a carcase in the open air. The first
vapour which rises, he says, is subtle and nauseous: some days after, it has
a certain sour and penetrating smell. After the first weeks the skin becomes
covered with a down, and appears yellowish; greenish spots are
formed in various places, which afterwards become livid and black; a thick
glosey or mouldy substance then covers the greatest part of the body: the
spots open and emit a sanies.” In such as are buried the decomposition
is much more slow; our author thinks <i>four times</i> at least. According
to M. Petit, a body buried at the depth of four feet is not decomposed
in less than three years, and, at a greater depth the decomposition
is still more slow. This decomposition is favoured by the presence of water,
and likewise by some kinds of earth more than others. It has been
proved by Lemery, Geoffroy, and others, that argillaceous earths have very little
effect in this way: porous and light earths much more: the roots of vegetables
also by absorbing the putrid effluvia contribute greatly to the final decomposition
of bodies buried in places exposed to the open air; but in churches
and other covered places the case is vastly different. “Here, says our
author, is neither water nor vegetation; and consequently no cause which
can carry away, dissolve or change the nature of the animal fluids: and
I cannot but applaud the wisdom of government which has prohibited the
burying in churches; a practice which was once a subject of horror and infection.</p>

<p>“The decomposition of a body in the bowels of the earth can never be dangerous,
provided it be buried at a sufficient depth, and that the grave be not
opened before its complete dissolution. The depth of the grave ought to be
such that the external air cannot penetrate it; that the juices with which
the earth is impregnated may not be conveyed to its surface; and that the
exhalations, vapours, or gases, which are developed or formed by decomposition,
should not be capable of forcing the earth covering which detains
them. The nature of the earth in which the grave is dug, influences all its
effects. If the stratum which covers the body be argillaceous, the depth of
the grave may be less, as this earth difficultly admits a passage to gas and
vapour; but, in general, it is admitted to be necessary that bodies should be
buried at the depth of five feet to prevent all these unhappy accidents. It
is likewise necessary to attend to the circumstance, that a grave ought not to
be opened before the complete decomposition of the body. The term of decomposition
is various; according to M. Petit of three years in graves of
four feet, and four years in those of six feet. The pernicious custom which
allows a single grave to families more or less numerous, ought therefore to
be suppressed; for, in this case the same grave may be opened before the
time prescribed. It is likewise necessary, to prohibit burying in vaults, or
even in coffins.”</p>

Sir John Pringle, from Stowe’s Chronicle, gives the following account of
these assizes. “On the 4th, 5th and 6th days of July were the assizes held
at Oxon, where was arraigned and condemned Rowland Jenkins, <i>for a seditious
tongue</i>; at which time there arose amidst the people such a damp, that
almost all were smothered. Very few escaped that were not taken. Here
died in Oxon three hundred persons; and sickened there, but died in other
places, two hundred and odd.</p>

<p>“The sessions at the Old Bailey in Westminster, in 1650, proved also fatal
to many; of which Sir John also gives an account. ‘I have been informed
(says he) that, at those Sessions, about a hundred were tried, who were all
kept in close places as long as the court sat; and that each room was but
14 feet by 11, and seven feet high. The bail-dock is also a small room
taken off one of the corners of the court, and left open at the top: in this,
during the trials, are put some of the malefactors who have been under the
closest confinement. The hall in the Old Bailey is a room of only 30 feet
square. Now whether the air was most tainted from the bar by some prisoners
then ill of the jail distemper, or by the general uncleanliness of such
persons, is uncertain; but it is probable that both causes concurred. And
we may easily conceive how much it might have been vitiated by the foul
steams of the bail-dock, and of the two rooms opening into the court in
which the prisoners were the whole day crowded together till they were
brought out to be tried. It appeared afterwards, that these places had not
been cleaned for some years. The poisonous quality of the air was aggravated
by the heat and closeness of the court, and by the perspirable matter
of a number of people of all sorts, penned up for the most part of the day,
without breathing the free air, or receiving any refreshment. The bench
consisted of six persons, whereof four died, together with two or three of
the counsel, one of the under sheriffs, several of the Middlesex jury, and
others present to the amount of above forty; without making allowance for
those of a lower rank, whose death may not have been heard of; and without
including any that did not sicken within a fortnight after the sessions.’”<br />

That this is the case with the atmosphere at Martinico is now determined
by a letter from Dr. George Davidson to Dr. Mitchell of New York, inserted
in the Medical Repository, vol.&nbsp;ii, p.&nbsp;279. With equal parts of nitrous and
atmospheric air there was an absorption of 67 parts out of 100; but when
two parts of atmospheric air were used to one of nitrous, the absorption was
only from 52 to 58 parts; with a mixture of iron filings and sulphur, upwards
of four tenths of the air were absorbed. These experiments were attested by
a number of medical gentlemen who were present. In a letter subjoined
from Dr. Chisholm, he says, that, having made a trial with iron filings and
sulphur, the absorption was forty parts of an hundred, or exactly four tenths,
with the eudiometer fifty-six. “It appears to me (says Dr. Chisholm) to be
a singular circumstance, that, although the ground on which the Ordnance
Hospital Hands is a perfect morass, partially drained, yet a result almost
exactly similar to that given by the experiments made with the eudiometer
at my house, should take place, with the same instrument and in circumstances
very different. The proportion at the Ordnance Hospital, I
think, has been 58 out of 100, and at your house, a situation less swampy,
and nearer the sea, it has been 67. An explanation of so singular a result,
in situations so different, is perhaps more to be wished than expected.”</p>

Dr. Gotwald, formerly quoted, describes four varieties of carbuncles, the
differences between which seem to be pretty distinctly marked. 1. “One
kind rises pretty high, is of a dark brown colour, the cuticle appearing as
if it were burnt, and it is surrounded with a lead-coloured circle. In the
beginning it is no bigger than a pea, but, if not prevented, soon grows to
the size of a crown piece; inwardly it is moister than the rest, and may be
more easily separated. Its seat is generally in the fleshy parts, as on the
shoulders, neck, hips, arms and legs. 2. The second lie a little deeper,
and do not rise so high; the eschar in the middle is entirely dark and
ash-coloured, full of small chops, as if it would burst by too great dryness:
it has a strong lead-coloured circle, behind which the sound flesh looks red
and shining. It eats into the flesh round about it, and takes deep root: it
generally fixes in the most fleshy parts, as the buttocks, calves, &amp;c. 3. The
third is not very large at first; it appears like a blood swelling, not so dark
as the former, with a wrinkled skin; as it increases, small blisters arise in
the middle, and form an eschar, in little clusters, which, as an ingenious
physician observed, were small carbuncles. They commonly are situated
in membranous and tendinous parts about the knees, toes, and behind the
ears, &amp;c. 4. The fourth is the most curious, as Purman, in his treatise on
the plague, has well observed. Sitonius calls them pale, livid, ulcerous
papulae: they appear with a high, yellowish blister, which seems full of corruption:
the circle round it is first red, then of an ash colour: the blister
soon falls, and, with the carbuncle, appears scarce so big as a pepper corn,
continually eating deeper and wider. They are seated upon the cartilaginous
or gristly parts. Gotwald found them near the pit of the stomach, upon
the cartilago ensiformis and short ribs. All the four take root and burn
very violently at first, but the two former most of all.”</p>

About the mouth of the river Gambia in Africa, after the annual inundation
of the river, the putrefaction of the mud, mixed with animal and vegetable
substances, becomes so great, that the birds manifest their disgust by soaring to
an immense height in the air. This is a natural consequence of the levity of
putrefactive vapours compared with the common atmosphere. As these vapours,
however, are composed of several kinds of gases, it is possible that some may
descend, while others ascend; and thus the contagious part, tending to the
earth, may violently affect the people who are confined among it, while the
birds escape; but there is still wanting some positive evidence that ever the
true plague did arise from this cause.</p>

It seems, however, of late, that at least the city of Madrid is kept clean.
Swinburne says, speaking of the palace at Madrid, “To the west it has the
town, the three principal streets of which terminate in the Pravo. These
are three noble openings, excellently paved, and clean even to a nicety;
indeed so are most of the streets of Madrid since the edict for paving and
cleaning them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> The foreigners that resided here before that time, shudder
at the very recollection of its former filth. Some of the natives regret the
old stinks and nastiness; as they pretend that the air of Madrid is so subtil
as to require a proper mixture of grosser effluvia, to prevent its pernicious
effects upon the constitution. The extremes of cold and heat are astonishing
in this place, and the winds so searching, that all the Spaniards wear leathern
under waistcoats, to preserve their chests; for they pervade every
other kind of clothing.”</p>

<p>The former filthiness of Madrid, together with its being situated in a climate
exposed to the vicissitudes of extreme heat and cold, and its exemption
from the plague under those circumstances, certainly presents a most solid objection
to the theory of the domestic origin of plague. To the same purpose
see below the remarks on the climate of China.</p>

Earthquakes, as we have already seen, might be accounted rather a <i>sign</i>
or <i>cause</i> of the beginning of pestilence, than of its departure. A great quantity
of electricity in the atmosphere has accordingly been enumerated among the
signs of an approaching pestilence. Thus in Burnet’s Thesaurus, p.&nbsp;699, we
find among the previous signs of a plague, “plurima et fere continua nocturna
fulgora, sine pluviis et tonitruis, cœlo non nubiloso existante.” Very much
and almost continual lightning at night, without rain or thunder; the sky in
the mean time not being covered with clouds.</p>

Before we can attach any degree of probability to either of these suppositions,
it must be proved that plagues arise out of the earth. But this, though

proof.</p>

In the plague, Dr. Russel has observed, that those who die in a very short
time are much less ready to communicate infection, than those who live longer.
He also takes notice, that “the plague, though a contagious disease, is
not equally contagious in every period of the pestilential season. In the
beginning those frequenting the sick often escape unhurt, or one only, out
of several, is infected. The escape of persons employed about the sick,
proves a frequent cause of misleading the popular opinion of the disease, and
has in many instances occasioned much mischief, by encouraging the neglect
of due precautions till too late.”</p>

Here, I hope, it will not be thought unreasonable to digress a little in
favour of the sensations of humanity which on all occasions ought to predominate
in our minds. Birds are the natural enemies of that hateful class of
beings we call <i>insects</i>, and which in general are the natural enemies of
man. In proportion to the havock we make among the former, the latter will
multiply upon us whether we will or not. The wanton, indiscriminate, and
I may add <i>provoking</i> destruction exercised among this useful as well as
beautiful and agreeable part of the creation, must certainly be sometimes attended
with bad consequences. Though birds feed on many different kinds
of insects, yet there are exceptions. If then we totally exterminate a species
of birds, is it not probable that a species of insects might appear, the mischief
done by which we could not be able to counteract? <i>Quere.</i> Is it not possible
that the <i>Hessian fly</i> may have made its appearance from this cause?</p>

This <i>doctrine</i> of <i>fancy</i>, or <i>imagination</i>, ought undoubtedly, as Dr. Russel
says of the imagination itself, to be under some management. The indiscriminate
use of the word has been carried to such a length as in a manner to
supersede all evidence, testimony, argumentation or reason. With some it is
sufficient to discredit the most positive testimony (even upon oath) if they
take it into their heads that such a thing <i>cannot be</i>: which by the bye is as
strong an evidence of <i>ignorance</i> as any man can give. If imagination is given
as a <i>cause</i>, the extent and nature of its powers ought to be ascertained; but
who has done this? On the contrary I may say that not one in five hundred
who makes use of the word would be able to define it. But the most curious
mode of reasoning used by these <i>imaginary</i> gentlemen is, if they are asked,
“How do you prove that such a thing is the effect of imagination?” they are
ready to answer, “I can indeed bring no proof that it is so, but how do you
prove that it is not?” Here the <i>imaginaries</i> have not <i>reason</i> sufficient to show
them that <i>they</i> ought to bring a proof, and not those who say they saw or felt
any thing. But, waving this, <i>sense</i> is the highest faculty in our nature; <i>imagination</i>
as well as <i>reason</i> are inferior to it; because neither the one nor the
other can be conversant except about the objects of sense. If any person
therefore says that he <i>sees</i> or that he <i>feels</i> any thing, nobody can, with any
shadow of reason, say that he neither <i>saw</i> nor <i>felt</i> any thing. If one man sees
what another cannot see, while the supposed object is easily within reach of
the eyes of either, then the one who cannot see it has a right to suspect that
the object is imaginary; but, if the person himself feels any slight pain or
uneasiness, and that should go off in a short time, after drinking a glass of
wine, there is as little reason to suppose that the pain was imaginary, as that
the drinking of the wine was imaginary. In Dr. Russel’s case, though his
strength was in general sufficient to resist the contagion in which he was immersed,
yet, when that strength began to decay, it was no wonder that he
found the contagion beginning to invade: a few glasses of wine gave vigour
to the system, and enabled it to repel the attack. Had he been much fatigued
with bodily labour, and found himself greatly relieved by a few
glasses of wine, surely he would not suppose that his former fatigue was merely
imaginary. Just so must it be in the former case; the one has no more to
do with imagination than the other.</p>

Dr. Dover, who wrote, in 1732, the <i>Ancient Physician’s Legacy</i>, had lodged
his soldiers in a church in which those who died of a plague had been buried.
An hundred and eighty of the soldiers were seized either with petechiæ or
buboes. He ordered them all to be bled in such quick succession, that the arm
of the first was not bound up till the blood flowed from the last. Thus every
one lost about an hundred ounces (upwards of three quarts.) He then ordered
them water acidulated with spirit of vitriol for their drink; and by this
treatment all recovered excepting eight, who would not refrain from spiritous
liquors. This was transacted in Peru: but in Europe the plague will scarce
bear bleeding to a few ounces. (Sauvages.)</p>

As it might by some be deemed an affront offered to the wisdom of antiquity,
should we pass over in silence the opinions of the more ancient physicians,
I shall in this note give a short account of some of their most remarkable
modes of practice, as they are recorded in Burnet’s <i>Thesaurus</i>.</p>

<p>1. Forestus, in many respects a respectable author, recommends an <i>antidote</i>
composed of equal parts of rue, figs and almonds, beat into a pulp in a stone
mortar with a wooden pestle till united (which is not very easily done) into an
uniform mass, adding as much syrup of citrons with vinegar as would render
it soft, with a little powdered salt put in last. The efficacy of this he tells us
he experienced in himself as well as all his family as a preventive; himself
taking in the morning the bigness of a small nutmeg of this, made up into a
confection with the ancient theriac, mithridate, Armenian bole, terrasigillata,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In his regular practice (for the above must be accounted quackery) he advises
bleeding within the first twelve, or at most twenty-four, hours; such as were
bled afterwards he says died. If performed in seven or eight hours after the
commencement of the disease the cure went on the better. Where bleeding
was inadvisable he used cupping with scarifications, finishing the cure with
sweating and cordials. He remarks that where black tumours or eschars, lentil
shaped, appeared, the disease always proved mortal, without a single exception.
These were small, like a grain of black pepper, and therefore called
by the vulgar <i>peppercorn</i>; undoubtedly the <i>tokens</i> of Dr. Hodges.</p>

<p>2. Hildanus, also a respectable writer, has an high opinion of issues as a
preventive. He says he never knew but one or two (and those of a very bad
habit of body) who had issues in their legs and arms that perished in the
plague, and says that he has known its efficacy as a preventive not only in
himself but many others. He says he kept two issues in his own body, one
in the left arm, the other in the right leg. (See above p.&nbsp;339) To the same
purpose Mercurialis relates that he never knew but one, and he was a <i>priest</i>,
who died of the plague having an issue. He says also that he had inquired
of many other physicians, who all gave a similar testimony. According to
him, in the plague at Lausanne, all who were attacked by vomiting or looseness,
and almost all who were bled, fell victims to the disease.</p>

<p>As preventives he advises amulets made up of arsenic, powder of <i>toads</i>, and
<i>other things</i>. These are to be hanged round the neck in times of plague, and
are <i>undoubtedly</i> of great virtue (<i>maximam</i> ad <i>præservationem vim habere, non
est quod dubites!</i>) This remedy he says he had from his preceptor <i>Cosmas
Slotanus</i>, a very celebrated surgeon.</p>

<p>Brine of pork is another preventive, which he never tried himself, but asks
Sennerius about it. It was recommended to Hildanus by a lawyer of his
acquaintance. The brine is first to be boiled in a kettle, and well skimmed,
till it becomes clear, poured into earthen vessels. and kept shut up from the air
for a twelvemonth; after which it was fit for use. A draught of this was
given to people infected with plague, and operated by sweat, stool or vomit,
or perhaps both by vomit and stool. The patient was to abstain from drink
for some hours after. The brine of <i>anchovies</i> is recommended by Sam. Formius,
as useful in the plague at Montpelier in 1630.</p>

<p>3. The same author (Formius) tells us of a man and his wife and wife’s
sister, in Montpelier, who, being taken with the plague, swallowed a solution
of their own excrements in urine, <i>strained through a linen cloth</i>, and thus got
clear of the distemper. It produced excessive vomiting and purging. Dr.
Russel mentions one of his patients, who, he suspected, had got a dose of bezoar
in urine.</p>

<p>4. Johannes Helmontius says, that <i>to his certain knowledge</i> (me conscio)
<i>Hibernus Butlerus</i> cured some thousands of the plague, at London; though
unhappily our author got only part of the secret, and which is to the following
purpose. “He ordered me to suspend by the legs before the fire, a large <i>toad</i>
taken in the afternoon in the month of June; putting below him a cake of
yellow wax. At length, after three days suspension, the toad vomited
earth, and some <i>walking insects</i> (insectas ambulantes) viz. <i>flies</i> with shining
wings of a greenish colour, as if gilt: the toad died immediately after this
evacuation, nor did it take place, notwithstanding his suspension till the
third day. He (Butlerus) then told me that I had medicine enough for curing
<i>forty thousand</i> people infected with the plague, and promised to show me
the mystery of the matter (rei cardinem) but being suddenly sent into banishment
he departed.” The best part of the secret being thus lost, it is
needless to trouble the reader with any further account of experiments made
with other toads roasted alive, powdered and made up into troches,&amp;c. presuming
that these could not equal the value of the original receipt. I proceed
therefore,</p>

<p>5. To the antidote of the celebrated Avenzoar, who drove away the plague
by the smell of the <i>urine</i> of an <i>he goat</i>; and Mercurialis says that in the house
of a most reverend canon in Hungary, he saw a large he goat kept for this
purpose.</p>

<p>6. From such horribly disgusting remedies we certainly turn with pleasure
to the elegant tablets prepared for the Emperor Maximilian II. These were
composed of Armenian bole, prepared pearl, prepared coral, prepared emeralds,
prepared jacinct, gold-leaves (ingredients in a medical view equally efficacious
with chalk or oyster shells) along with a little ambergrease and some other ingredients
of little value, as medicines, and made into tablets with conserve of
roses&mdash;&mdash;It is needless to spend time in commenting on such ridiculous
remedies; suffice it to say, that the intention of all rational practice both
ancient and modern has been to effect a cure by sweating. From the instance
related by Sydenham, as well as that of Dr. Power above mentioned, it seems,
that if the exact time in which the disease begins could be known, it might be
carried off by profuse blood-letting; but as this for the most part cannot be
discovered, it is certainly better to wait, even though the event should not
prove favourable, than to run the risk of killing, the patient instantly by an
ignorant effort to save him.</p>

In Belknap’s Biography we have a more particular account of this <i>pestilence</i>,
as it is called, and which, if the relations there given are to be credited,
certainly determines the disease in question to have been the yellow fever.
The account is to the following purpose: Lord Arundel, of Wardour, had
employed a captain Weymouth to search for a N.&nbsp;W. passage to India. In
this he failed, but falling in with a river, supposed to be either the Kennebeck
or Penobscot, he brought from thence five of the natives, with whom he landed
at Plymouth in July 1605. Three of the Indians were taken into the
family of Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and from these many particulars were obtained
respecting their country, which being eagerly attended to by Gorges,
he formed a plan of advancing his fortune by a thorough discovery of the
country. Two vessels were accordingly fitted out; one of which failed, but the
other brought such information as gave encouragement to attempt the founding
of a colony. Two of the natives who had been brought to England were
sent back, and 45 persons were left on the continent to begin the settlement;
but these, having undergone great hardships, quitted the place in 1608. Gorges,
however was not discouraged. He sent out one of his servants, by name
<i>Richard Vines</i>, and some others, whom he hired to stay in the country all
winter.</p>

<p>“Mr. Vines and his companions were received by the Indians with great
hospitality, though their residence among them was rendered hazardous;
both by a war which raged among them, and by a pestilence which accompanied
or succeeded it.</p>

<p>“This war and pestilence are frequently spoken of by the historians of
New England, as remarkable events, in the course of Providence, which
prepared the way for the establishment of an European colony. Concerning
the war, we know nothing more than this, that it was begun by the Tarratenes,
a nation who resided eastward of Penobscot. These formidable
people surprised the bashaba, or chief sachem, at his head quarters, and destroyed
him with all his family; upon which all the other sachems who
were subordinate to him quarrelled among themselves for the sovereignty;
and in these dissensions many of them as well as of their unhappy people
perished. Of what particular kind the pestilence was, we have no <span class="nowrap">certain<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span>
information, but it seems to have been a disorder peculiar to the Indians,
for Mr. Vines and his companions, who were intimately conversant with
them, and frequently lodged in their wigwams, were not in the least degree
affected by it, though it swept off the Indians at such a prodigious rate
that the living were not able to bury the dead, and their bones were found
several years after, lying about the villages where they had resided. The
extent of this pestilence was between Penobscot in the east, and Narraganset
in the west. These two tribes escaped, whilst the intermediate people were
wasted and destroyed.”</p>

<p>This distemper appears to have raged among the Indians in the year 1616.
The following particulars are further given in Belknap’s Biography, vol.&nbsp;ii,
p. 208: “Hitherto they (the English colonists) had not seen any of the natives
at this place. The mortal pestilence which raged through the country,
four years before, had almost depopulated it. One remarkable circumstance
attending this pestilence was not known till after this settlement was made.
A French ship had been wrecked on Cape Cod. The men were saved, with
their provisions and goods. The natives kept their eye on them, till they
found an opportunity to kill all but three or four, and divide their goods.
The captives were sent from one tribe to another, as slaves. One of them
learned so much of their language, as to tell them that God was angry with
them for their cruelty, and would destroy them, and give their country to
another people. They answered that they were too many for God to kill.
He replied, that if they were ever so many, God had many ways to kill
them, of which they were then ignorant. When the pestilence came among
them (a <i>new disease</i>, probably the <i>yellow fever</i>) they remembered the
Frenchman’s words; and when the Plymouth settlers arrived at Cape Cod,
the few survivors imagined that the other part of his prediction would soon
be accomplished. Soon after their arrival, the Indian priests or powows
convened, and performed their incantations in a dark swamp three days
successively, with a view to curse and destroy the new comers. Had they
known the mortality which raged among them, they would doubtless have
rejoiced in the success of their endeavours, and might very easily have taken
advantage of their weakness to exterminate them. But none of them were
seen till after the sickness had abated; though some tools, which had been
left in the woods, were missing, which they had stolen in the night.”</p>

“The Pawkunnawkutts were a great people heretofore. They lived to
the east and northeast of the Narragansitts, and their chief sachem held dominion
over divers other petty sagamores; as the sagamores upon the island
of Nantuckett, and Nope, or Martha’s Vineyard, of Nawsett, of Mannamoyk,
of Sawkattukett, Nobsquasitt, Matakees, and several others, and
some of the Nipmucks. Their country, for the most part, falls within
the jurisdiction of New Plymouth colony. This people were a potent nation
in former times, and could raise, as the most credible and ancient Indians
affirm, about three thousand men. They held war with the Narragansitts,
and often joined the Massachusetts as friends and confederates
against the Narragansitts. This nation, a very great number of them, were
swept away by an epidemical and unwonted sickness, an. 1612 and 1613,
about seven or eight years before the English first arrived in those parts to
settle the colony of New Plymouth. Thereby Divine Providence made way
for the quiet and peaceable settlement of the English in those nations.
What this disease was, that so generally and mortally swept away, not only
these but other Indians, their neighbours, I cannot well learn. Doubtless
it was some pestilential disease. I have discoursed with some old Indians,
that were then youths, who say, that the bodies all over were exceeding <i>yellow</i>
(describing it by a yellow garment they showed me) both before they
died, and afterward.</p>

<p>“The Massachusetts, being the next great people northward, inhabited
principally about that place in Massachusetts bay, where the body of the
English now dwell. These were a numerous and great people. Their chief
sachem held dominion over many other petty governors; as those of Weechagaskas,
Neponsitt, Punkapaog, Nonantum, Nashaway, some of the
Nipmuck people, as far as Pocomtacuke, as the old men of Massachusetts
affirmed. This people could, in former times, arm for war about three
thousand men, as the old Indians declare. They were in hostility very often
with the Narragansitts, but held amity for the most part with the Pawkunnawcutts,
who lived on the south border, and with the Pawtucketts, who
inhabited on their north and northeast limits. In an. 1612 and 1613 these
people were also sorely smitten by the hand of God with the same disease
before mentioned; which destroyed the most of them, and made room for
the English people of Massachusetts colony, which people this country, and
the next called Pawtuckett. There are not of this people left at this day
above three hundred men, besides women and children.</p>

<p>“Pawtuckett is the fifth and last great sachemship of Indians. Their country
lieth north and northeast from the Massachusetts, whose dominion reacheth
so far as the English jurisdiction, or colony of the Massachusetts, doth
now extend, and had under them several other smaller sagamores; as the
Pennakoaks, Agawomes, Naamkeeks, Pascatawayes, Accomintas, and others.
They were also a considerable people heretofore, about three thousand men,
and held amity with the people of Massachusetts. But these also were almost
totally destroyed by the great sickness before mentioned; so that at
this day they are not above two hundred and fifty men, besides women and
children. This country is now inhabited by the English under the government
of Massachusetts.” (Gookin’s Historical Collections of the Indians
in New England.)</p>

<p>The following was communicated to Benjamin Basset, esq. of Chilmark,
by Thomas Cooper, a half blooded Indian, of Gay Head, aged about sixty
years; and which, he says, he obtained of his grandmother, who, to use his
own expression, was a stout girl when the English came to the island: “Before
the English came among the Indians, there were two disorders of which
they generally died, viz. the consumption and the yellow fever. The latter
they could always <i>lay</i> in the following manner: After it had raged and swept
off a number, those who were well, met to lay it. The rich, that is, such
as had a canoe, skins, axes, &amp;c. brought them; They took their seat in a
circle, and all the poor sat around without. The richest then proposed to
begin to lay the sickness; and, having in his hand something in shape resembling
his canoe, skin, or whatever his riches were, he threw it up in the air;
and whoever of the poor without could take it, the property it was intended
to resemble became for ever transferred to him or her. After the rich had
thus given away all their moveable property to the poor, they looked out the
handsomest and most sprightly young man in the assembly, and put him
into an entire new wigwam, built of every thing new for that purpose.
They then formed into two files at a small distance from each other; one
standing in the space at each end put fire to the bottom of the wigwam on
all parts, and fell to singing and dancing. Presently the youth would leap
out of the flames, and fall down to appearance dead. Him they committed
to the care of five virgins, prepared for that purpose, to restore to life again.
The term required for this would be uncertain, from six to forty-eight hours,
during which time the dance must be kept up. When he was restored he
would tell, that he had been carried in a large thing high up in the air, where
he came to a great company of white people, with whom he had interceded
hard to have the distemper laid, and generally, after much persuasion, would
obtain a promise, or answer of peace, which never failed of laying the
distemper.”</p>

<p>The following is extracted from Prince’s Chronological History of New
England, p.&nbsp;46: “This winter (1617) and the spring ensuing, a great plague
befals the natives in New England, which wasteth them exceedingly; and
so many thousands of them die, that the living are not able to bury them,
and their skulls and bones remain above ground at the places of their habitations
for several years after.</p>

<p>“By Capt. Dermer’s letter of Dec. 27, 1619, in Purchas, and of June 30,
1620, in Gov. Bradford, compared with Gov. Bradford’s own account, it
seems that the Narragansitts in the west, and Penobscots in the east, escaped
this plague, or that it raged only in the countries lying between them, and
prepared the way for another people.”</p>

In Dr. Rush’s account of the fever of 1793, we find the following remarks
on the French mode of practice to which it seems remarkable that our author
has given no answer: “I proceed with reluctance to inquire into the comparative
success of the French practice. It would not be difficult to decide
upon it from many facts that came under my notice in the city; but I shall
rest its merit wholly upon the returns of the number of deaths at Bush-hill.
This hospital, after the 22d of September, was put under the care of a
French physician, who was assisted by one of the physicians of the city. The
hospital was in a pleasant and airy situation; it was provided with all the
necessaries and comforts for sick people that humanity could invent, or liberality
supply. The attendants were devoted to their duty, and cleanliness
and order pervaded every room in the house. The reputation of this hospital,
and of the French physician, drew patients to it in the early stage of
the disorder. Of this I have been assured in a letter from Dr. Annan, who
was appointed to examine and give orders of admission into the hospital to
such of the poor of the district of Southwark, as could not be taken care of in
their own houses. Mr. Olden has likewise informed me, that most of the
patients who were sent to the hospital by the city committee (of which he
was a member) were in the first stage of the fever. With all these advantages,
the deaths between the 22d of September and the 6th of November,
amounted to 448 out of 807 patients who were admitted into the hospital
within that time. Three fourths of all the blacks (nearly 20) who were patients
in this hospital died. A list of the medicines prescribed there may be
seen in the minutes of the proceedings of the city committee. Calomel and
jalap are not among them. Moderate bleeding and purging with glauber
salts, I have been informed were used in some cases by the physicians of
this hospital. The proportion of deaths to the recoveries, as it appears in
the minutes of the committee from whence the report is taken, is truly melancholy!”</p>

This account is taken from the Annals of Medicine for 1798, and appears
in a letter from Dr. Guthrie at Petersburg to Dr. Duncan at Edinburgh. It
is drawn up with such <i>astonishing</i> inaccuracy, that we may well be surprised
how the one physician should write, and the other print it. There seems in
the first place to have been a mistake of Reaumur’s thermometer for Fahrenheit’s.
But even this will not rectify the account. The <i>zero</i> or (0) on Reaumur’s
scale is the freezing point of water; on Fahrenheit’s it is the cold produced
by a mixture of salt and snow, 32 degrees below the freezing point of
water. The freezing point of quicksilver has been fixed at 39, <span class="nowrap">39 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> or 40
degrees below the cold produced by salt and snow. When the thermometer
therefore fell to 40 deg. below the freezing point of water, it was only eight
degrees below the cold of salt and snow, and not equal to the congelation
of mercury by more than thirty degrees. The difference between this
and <i>forty-two</i> degrees below the freezing point of quicksilver is enormous
and incredible. It indicates a degree of cold hitherto unobserved on the face
of the earth, and scarcely equalled by the latest experiments made at Hudson’s
bay, where, by means of vitriolic acid and snow, the thermometer was made
to indicate a degree of cold 40 degrees below the freezing point of quicksilver.
The inaccuracy and confusion of this account, however, does not affect the
subsequent part relative to Mr. Billings’s journey.</p>

If sulphur be a <i>simple</i> substance, as the new chemists pretend, there ought
never to be any variation in its properties, except what arises from mere impurity;
but the following is a remarkable instance to the contrary: Dr. Crawford
(brother to the celebrated Adair Crawford) informed me, that for his oil
of vitriol works at Lisburn, in Ireland, he had purchased <i>five tons</i> of sulphur
produced from copper mines in the island of Anglesey. The sulphur looked
well, and was not more impure than what he commonly used; but, on trial,
the produce of acid fell so much short of what he had been accustomed to
receive, that it would not afford the expense of manufacturing. An experiment
on such a large scale could not be erroneous. If sulphur is a simple substance,
the fact is unaccountable: if it is composed of phlogiston and acid, an
over proportion of the former will easily account for it.</p>

The following account of the poisonous insects of Russia, extracted from
Dr. Guthrie’s letter to Dr. Duncan (Med. Annals vol.&nbsp;iii, p.&nbsp;396) may be not
unacceptable to the reader: “I have lately seen (says Dr. Guthrie) a woman
with her hand and arm in a most violent state of irritation from the lodgement
of the lumbricus melitensis, a worm not much thicker than a horse-hair
which had entered her thumb whilst at work in a marshy spot, and
was, when I saw her, a day after the accident, on its way up the arm, with
excruciating pain. I must own that I should not have known the nature
of the disease, if a fellow-peasant had not immediately declared that
it was produced by the dangerous worm; which many of these people are
acquainted with to their cost, as an inhabitant of the stagnant pools and
marshes in that district, about sixty versts to the southwest of Petersburgh.
I must farther acknowledge, that I was happy to hear the patient was to
be instantly transported to another village, where a famous operator lived,
well skilled in the art of extracting the venomous insect; as I should certainly
have gone very awkwardly to work if I had been obliged to operate;
though the simple peasants perform it with success and safety, gradually
winding the worm round a quill, till the whole animal be extracted; a work
of much patience and perseverance. I was very sorry that duty obliged me
to be in town the same evening, a drive of sixty versts. It was therefore
impossible for me to accompany the patient, though I was very desirous of
witnessing this village-operation.</p>

<p>“But Russia is pestered with a still more dangerous worm; the furia infernalis.
It is still smaller than the former, not being thicker than a human
hair. This infernal insect, from its extreme lightness, is often carried up
into the air, with the dust, by whirlwinds; and, if it unfortunately falls on
the uncovered part of a man or beast, it enters the flesh in an instant, and
soon proves mortal, if a remedy be not quickly applied.</p>

<p>“Our new vice-governor of Petersburg lately came down from Siberia,
where he was commandant of a fort. He tells me, that in the district of
Nerchinsk, where he commanded, the peasants, as well as their cattle, are
often destroyed by an insect falling upon them. To prevent this accident
from proving fatal, the part is instantly scarified, and rubbed with a mixture
of snuff and sal ammoniac.</p>

<p>“This I am convinced must be the furia infernalis; more especially as he
assured me, that the insect was so very minute, that none of the peasants
had ever seen it when it fell upon them, and that they had no idea of its
nature and form. But one circumstance of his, recited, almost staggered
my belief; that the carcase of an animal killed by this insect is almost as dangerous
as the insect itself. This phenomenon I cannot account for in any
other way but by supposing, as the accident always happens in the hot months
of the year, that a high degree of putridity is produced by the venomous
worm, when the case proves fatal.</p>

<p>“I informed the vice-governor of the manner in which the Dalecarlian peasants
in Sweden treat the accident, in order that he might communicate their
mode of cure to his Siberian acquaintance, which is merely applying to the
part affected a piece of sweet curd. The insect possibly prefers this to flesh,
and leaves the one for the other. I am, however, much afraid that this simple
remedy will seldom be at hand in Russia, as the peasants are unacquainted
with the use of rennet, but prepare a sour curd by means of heat, throughout
the whole empire; evidently taking its origin in the Tartar Koumis,
and shewing them to be a people of Scythian extraction. They likewise
separate butter from milk by heat, instead of the churn; a curious circumstance
probably unknown to you before.</p>

<p>“These two dangerous insects are, however, not all which threaten the
life of man in this empire: the southern provinces are infected with a third,
the bite of which is as mortal as that of the deadly rattlesnake, if the part
be not instantly scarified, and rubbed with fresh butter. This is a species
of crab-spider, the phalangium acaroides, resembling the tarantula, but rather
thinner and smaller. It however kills and devours that formidable
spider in a few minutes, which, when compared with it, is an innocent
animal.</p>

<p>“Your acquaintance, Mrs. Guthrie, lately returned from a tour on account
of health, along the north shore of the Black Sea. Among much important
and curious information, she gave me some account of the cure employed
for the bite of this mortal spider, which finds many lurking-places among
the ruined buildings of the ancient Chersonesus Taurica, or Crimea, laid
waste in the last Turkish war. It is a curious fact, that animal oil counteracts
the venom of the spider tribes, as vegetable oils do the venom
of serpents. I suspect, however, that either of them would counteract both
poisons; indeed, I think we have a proof of animal oil acting wonderfully
on serpents, in the anecdote related by Bruce, when the deadly cerastes, or
viper of the Nile, turned away its head from the oily breast of the prime
minister of Fenaar, when he carelessly took it up in his hand, and applied
it to his naked bosom, to show Mr. Bruce how innocent it was to men of his
colour, whose very skin sickened the animal, and made it avoid all contact.”</p>

Arguments of this kind involve us in an endless dispute similar to that
relative to the <i>equivocal generation</i> of plants and animals; that is, the
production of plants without a seed, and animals without parents. As some
diseases are confessed to arise from some kind of seed, we are puzzled to account
for the origin of the <i>first</i> disease of that kind. Nevertheless, as these
diseases do exist, the difficulty arising from a consideration of their origin is
overlooked. In the yellow fever, which is not of so long standing, the origin
is more disputed. But it is likewise undeniable, that some contagious distempers
(the itch particularly) though capable of being propagated by contagion,
may yet arise from want of cleanliness, and living on particular kinds of food.
May not this also be the case with the yellow fever? And is it not the safe
and rational way to act as though it might not only be produced at home, but
imported from abroad?</p>

</div>

No greater latitude, or very little more, is required by the advocates for
the contagious nature of the yellow fever than Dr. Seaman must allow in a
distemper which he himself owns to be contagious. It is well known, on the
eastern continent at least, that a gonorrhœa will come on at any time between
the first and <i>fifteenth</i> day after the infection is received. Dr. Guthrie supposes
the time intervening between the reception of pestilential contagion and
the appearance of the symptoms to be four days; and Dr. Chisholm thinks
that in the Boullam fever it is somewhat short of two days: but it is plain
that much must depend on the quantity of contagion, and the predisposition
of the body to receive it.</p>

Dr. Seaman, having at last, as he thinks, completely overthrown his adversaries,
and ranked himself with the <i>more considerate</i> and <i>reasonable</i> part of
the community, likens those who differ from him to such as believe in the <i>power
of imagination</i> to mark the child in the womb; and which he is of opinion that
the women of America would not disbelieve, though all the physicians on the
continent were to unite in persuading them to the contrary. On this subject
the writer of this treatise is happy at having it in his power to declare himself
of the same opinion with the ladies, and to offer, in support of their opinion
and his, the following fact. A pregnant woman, having been employed in
dyeing some cotton yarn, and rinsed it, after it had got the colour, in cold
water, threw it, while wet and cold, about her neck. It touched the skin on
the back part of the neck, and part of her arm. The woman started, shivered,
and instantly said that her child would be <i>marked</i>. It happened exactly according
to her prediction. The back part of the neck, and corresponding
part of the arm to that which the cotton touched, being covered with purple
spots in the child, exactly similar to what might have been made by drops of
the purple liquid in which the yarn was dyed falling upon the skin. Of this
fact I am as certain as of my own existence; having been present when the
cotton was dyed, having heard the woman call out as above related, and seen
the child after it was born, and particularly inspected the marks.</p>

military operations by diseases, gives an account of general Dalling’s expedition
in 1780, where the English troops, confined in the castle of St. Juan, in
an unhealthy situation on the river Nicaragua, were cut off by diseases; but
these were fluxes and intermittents. He doth not mention the yellow fever
among them. He tells us indeed that the troops under general Garth brought
the jail fever along with them, and that those who returned to Jamaica were
harassed with obstinate intermittents, with diarrhœa, dysentery, or painful
enlargements of the liver and spleen.</p>

This position of Dr. Moseley is not universally received. The meaning
of the word <i>remission</i> certainly is a temporary abatement, and implies a
recurrence, of the same symptoms which originally took place. Dr. Moseley
describes the yellow fever as beginning with one kind of symptoms which
suddenly cease and are succeeded after a certain interval by others of a quite
different kind; and he claims the discovery as his own. If he be right in
this description, the yellow fever is certainly not a remittent; if otherwise,
it must be difficult to establish any true distinction between them.</p>

At Strasburg, in Germany, our author says that he saw a man who had
been an idiot for more than a year from a stroke of the sun. The 8th of July
1707 was so hot in England that many people died at their work, and many
horses and oxen were killed by the sun’s rays. In 1743, <i>eleven thousand</i> people
perished from the 14th to the 25th of July in the streets of Pekin in China.
On the 30th of July, 1705, the heat at Montpelier was so great, that eggs were
roasted by it. Chalmers, in his account of the weather and diseases of South
Carolina, says, that he has seen a beef-steak, laid on a cannon for twenty
minutes, deprived of its juices, and overdone by the excessive force of the
sun’s rays.</p>

This proves that Dr. Treat <i>was not</i> the first person who suffered by
this disease but it will not prove that the disease was not imported by capt.
Bird’s vessel; for the fever spread in the vicinity of the vessel, not of the
almshouse, where the first patient was carried.</p>

The following facts, in confirmation of the importation of the yellow
fever, were communicated in a letter from an eminent practitioner in New
Haven to a gentleman of the same profession in this town. They came to hand
too late to be inserted otherwise than in a note, the sheet being already prepared
for press:</p>

<p>A child was reported to have died of worms, and the parents were indulged
in the common ceremonies of burial: but the truth was, that the disease had
been the black vomit. The consequence was, a very extensive spread of the
contagion. In less than a week six out of eight of the bearers were taken
with the fever, and these were young persons from different parts of the town.
“As to the suppositions (says the gentleman) with respect to local causes originating
the disease, I conceive there is no occasion to seek for any other
than what was contained in the chest (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_444">444</a>) which was a blanket and
clothing taken off the corpse of one who had died of the fever in the West
Indies, and without the least formality of cleaning put down into a close
chest, and brought to New Haven, and lodged in Austin’s store. Now it
appears to me (these facts well ascertained) as idle to inquire after other
causes, as it would, suppose it were the infection of the small pox brought
in a chest, and a number of persons who had inspected the chest to be taken
down with it. Would, in such a case, mankind have racked their inventions
to have investigated other inducing causes? Surely not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As to
local putrefying substances, there was nothing but what has been common
to the place, where the fever made its first appearance, for many years in dry
summers.</p>

<p>“I might revert to the introduction of the fever by importation at Chatham
on Connecticut river; at Providence, Rhode Island; in which the importation
was as evident as at New Haven. In short, there is scarcely a place on
the continent, where this fever has made its appearance, but what it may
be traced to an imported origin. There have been but two or three exceptions
which I have heard of.”</p>

<p>The following particulars relative to the disease at Portsmouth may likewise
be deemed authentic, as communicated by a respectable gentleman
(though not of the medical profession) in that place; “Most men of judgment
and information on the subject suppose it was imported last year in
a ship of Mr. Sheafe, which arrived from Martinico about the 20th of July.
One man had died on board this ship in the West Indies: all the rest arrived
in health; but the disorder made its appearance in a few days afterwards.
Mr. Sheafe lost three of his own family. He lived within a stone’s
throw of the wharf where his ship lay, and the fever spread in the neighbourhood.
Mr. Plummer, in the next house to Mr. Sheafe’s, died about the
10th of August; Miss Parker, in the same house, four days afterwards; and
Miss Smith, who had lived nearly opposite, removed to Berwick, and was
there seized and died about the same time. It is worthy of remark, that
this was always thought the most healthy part of the town.”</p>

<p>As a contrast to these evidences, we subjoin the following epitome of part of
Dr. Rush’s address to the citizens of Philadelphia on the origin of the yellow
fever, &amp;c<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> In this address, the Doctor considers it as indisputable that the
disease is, in all countries, the offspring of putrid vegetable and animal exhalations;
but it prevails only in hot climates and in hot seasons. In Philadelphia
it arises, 1. From the docks; and hence, in New York, it has got the
name of the <i>dock fever</i>. 2. From the foul air of ships. 3. From the common
sewers. 4. From the gutters. 5. From dirty cellars and yards. 6. Privies.
7. Putrefying masses of matter lying in the neighbouring part of the
city. 8. Impure pump water.</p>

<p>The disease is considered by the Doctor as an higher degree of bilious fever.
He answers the objection by Dr. Chisholm (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_467">467</a>.) where he speaks of
the fever not being produced in 1778, “when it was left in a more filthy state
by the British army than it has been at any time since.” To this he answers
that for the production of the disease three things are necessary. 1. Putrid
exhalations. 2. An inflammatory constitution of the atmosphere, and, 3. An
exciting cause, such as great heat, cold, fatigue, or intemperance. The constitution
of the atmosphere, however, he looks upon to be the principal cause;
as without this constitution mild diseases would be produced, but along with
it they become very malignant. “The pestilential constitution of the air
in the United States began in 1791. It prevailed in Charleston in 1792,
and it has been epidemic in one or more of the cities or country towns of the
United States every year since.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It has not been confined to the seaports.
It has prevailed since the year 1793 in many of the villages of New
England, and of the southern states. On the Genesee river it has become
so prevalent as to acquire the name of the Genesee fever. The bilious fevers
which prevailed in all the above places before the year 1793 were of a mild
nature, and seldom mortal. They have lately disappeared, or are much diminished;
and have been succeeded by a fever which frequently terminates
in death in five days, with a yellow skin and black vomiting.” These
circumstances are supported by undeniable testimony.</p>

<p>In answer to the question, “Can the yellow fever be imported?” Our author
answers as follows;  “I once thought it might; but the foregoing facts authorise
me to assert, that it cannot, so as to become <i>epidemic</i> in any city or
country. There are but two authorities on which the belief of this disease
being imported rests. These are Dr. Lining’s and Dr. Lind’s. The former
says it was imported into Charleston in 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748. The
latter says it was conveyed into Philadelphia, where it afterwards became
epidemic, by means of the clothes of a young man who died in Barbadoes.
No circumstances of ships or names are mentioned with these assertions to
entitle them to credit, and from the facility with which vague reports of
the foreign origin of this disease have been admitted and propagated by physicians
in other countries, there is reason to believe the assertions of those
two physicians are altogether without foundation. The College of Physicians
of Philadelphia, after two weeks investigation, were unable to discover
any ships, clothes, or sick person, that could have introduced the disease into
Philadelphia in the year 1793. The Academy of Medicine have clearly
proved, by many documents, that the disease was not imported in the years
1797 and 1798. The origin of a few cases, reported by Dr. Griffitts and
other members of the College of Physicians, which have lately appeared in
our city, has in vain been sought for from a prize sloop of the Ganges. Two
affidavits of Messieurs Hill and Ingersol prove that she had been healthy in
the West Indies, and that no person had been sick on board of her during
her voyage, nor after her arrival in our port. Equally unsuccessful have
been the attempts to derive those cases from beds and blankets infected by
the fever of last year. In Boston, Connecticut, New York, Baltimore, Norfolk
and Charleston, both physicians and citizens have long ago rejected the
opinion of the importation of the fever. Some physicians suppose it possible
for the contagion of this fever to adhere to the timbers of ships that have
sailed from West India ports, and that it may be propagated from them to a
whole neighbourhood, although houses, and even streets, interpose between
them. This opinion is too absurd to stand in need of refutation. Indeed
every thing that relates to the importation of this fever is contrary to reason
and facts&mdash;It is an error, substituted in the room of a belief that all pestilential
diseases were derived from the planets.”</p>

This author relates the following curious anecdote concerning tea-drinking:
“We had a gentleman in Switzerland, who in every respect knew how
to assume the tone of majesty. He was told one day that nothing elevated
the dignity of a king so much as when every thing around him had a pale
look. This intimation was sufficient for him. He directed all his servants
to be blooded once a month, and obliged each of them to swallow fifty dishes
of tea every day.” Tea is said to produce a cadaverous hue in the person who
drinks it after bloodletting.</p>

It is not easy to understand this. Nitre cannot deflagrate or burn, unless
it be mixed with charcoal, sulphur, or some inflammable substance. The iron
heater could only expel the water, with a small proportion of acid.</p>

Dr. Rush pathetically laments the loss of Dr. Nicholas Way, who had
been his intimate friend. In a poem called the <i>Political Greenhouse</i> we find
some account of the death of Drs. Smith, Cooper and Scandella, who also perished;
and the fates of Drs. Smith and Scandella were connected with one
another. Dr. Cooper of Philadelphia was seized with the disease in that city.
A friend who attended him sickened during his attendance, and Dr. Cooper,
before he had thoroughly recovered, attended in his turn the friend who had
taken care of him. A relapse ensued, and the Doctor died. Dr. Smith was
intimate with Dr. Scandella of Venice, who had come from thence to America,
and was at New York during the time of the fever in 1798. Intending to
return to Europe, he waited there for the English packet boat; but, being informed
that a foreign lady in Philadelphia, for whose daughter he had an attachment,
was sick of the yellow fever, he returned to that city; but could
not save either mother or daughter from the cruel disease. On Scandella’s
coming to New York the second time he could find no body that would receive
him as a lodger. In this forlorn situation he wrote to Dr. Smith, who
instantly gave him an invitation to his house. Here he was seized with the
fever, and was attended by Dr. Smith, until the latter also fell sick. A friend
who lived in the house attended first Dr. Scandella, and then Dr. Smith, until
both died.</p>

From the accounts of the most eminent practitioners it appears that the
fever of 1798 differed considerably in its nature from that of 1793. In Philadelphia
particularly there were many cases that could not bear the stroke of
a lancet. In Boston it seems to have partaken more of the nature of the true
plague than in other places and other years. The dissections of Drs. Rand
and Warren manifest a difference between the effects of it on the body at that
time, and what they were in former years. Buboes, carbuncles, or what were
thought to be so, and petechiæ, were observed here, as well as in New York.
One remarkable case, related in the next section, shows a disposition to induration,
very uncommon in the yellow fever, though so common in the true
plague that in the former part of this treatise it is taken for the characteristic
mark of the disease. None of those eschars called <i>tokens</i>, however, were in
any case observed. The disease here bore bleeding much better than at Philadelphia;
but mercury was always the most efficacious remedy, where a salivation
could be raised. The warm bath was used in some cases with success.
Large evacuations were useful, and some patients bore three or four bleedings,
with repeated doses of jalap and calomel. The distemper is by one gentleman
styled a novel disease, and differing essentially from other bilious complaints.
In one case the patient died of apoplexy; and another would probably have
shared the same fate, had it not been for timely bleeding. The black vomit
was almost inevitably attended with death. The matter evacuated was
thought to be extravasated blood from vessels in some cases mortified. The
yellow colour was judged merely accidental; but Dr. Lind’s opinion of its
arising from a dissolution of the blood seems now to be universally abandoned,
and the colour is supposed to arise from a suffusion of bile, owing either to
the obstruction of the ducts, or too great secretion.</p>

<p>The names of the gentlemen upon whole authority the above facts stand
cannot be mentioned, as permission for so doing has not been obtained. Their
authenticity, however, can be proved by undeniable documents.</p>

<p>The origin of the fever at Boston has, as usual, been disputed; but the common
opinion is that it was generated. It now appears, however, that, though
there are very strong reasons for supposing it to have originated in the place,
there are others equally strong for believing that it was imported. It is ascertained
that a vessel on board which persons had died with the yellow fever
lay in the neighbourhood of the family first seized with the disease in 1798.
On the other hand, there were instances of many that were seized with the
distemper who had not even left their houses for months previous to the contagious
period. This year (1799) there have been unquestionable proofs of
the importation of the fever from the Havana. The quarantine, however
has kept the infection from spreading; though the state of the atmosphere
has been much less favourable to the disease than last year, and has therefore
no doubt contributed to preserve the health of the people.</p>

<p>We have been favoured with the following list of those affected with the
disease this year at Newburyport:</p>

<p>“The fever unequivocally the same which prevailed in this town in 1796,
and in Boston and Portsmouth the last summer.</p>

<p>“The vessel supposed to have introduced the disease was the schooner
Sally, Joseph Gunnison master, which arrived at Bartlett’s wharf on the
morning of the 29th of June last, after a passage of 18 days, from St. Thomas’s,
where the yellow fever prevailed and was very mortal, with 17
tierces of sugar, and cash in bags. She discharged her cargo before one
o’clock on the day of her arrival. In the same afternoon her stone ballast,
taken on board at St. Thomas’s, was thrown on deck. On the first of July
she was moved to a wharf 10 rods below, and her ballast was thrown on a
pier wholly covered with water. This ballast was covered with a viscous
substance, which adhered to the fingers, and was very offensive to the people
working on the pier. On the same day she was hauled in between the
two wharves, and graved, and removed back to Bartlett’s wharf, where she
was loaded with lumber for another voyage, on which the sailed the
11th of July.</p>

<p>“It is still questioned whether this fever was imported, or generated in the
town. You will find that all who have had it have been connected with that
vessel, or lived or worked near where she lay, or visited the sick near the place
where the vessel was graved. And undoubtedly there were many persons
alike connected and situated who did not take it, although the inhabitants
living near the wharf very soon moved away. It is said that there is an old
distil-house near the bottom of the wharf, which has not been used for
many years, and that the tubs and cisterns are replete with putrid exhalations.
I do not know that this fact has been verified. It is also said that
back of the store used by the deceased Jonathan Pearson, were brewers’, soap
boilers’ and tallow-chandlers’ works which had all been used in the last-spring.
This is true; but I do not know that it is evident that any putrid
substances were formed there. Dr. Vergnies informs me that there was one
case of the yellow fever 2 days before the vessel arrived. In my mind the
weight of evidence in favour of the importation greatly preponderates. In
1796 the evidence was very unequivocal that the fever was generated.</p>

<p>“Just before the vessel arrived we had some very warm weather, and the
heat was oppressive to the feelings. The thermometer two afternoons was
at 90 deg. Perhaps it may not be unuseful to mention that calomel was
given liberally. All who recovered were salivated. All who could not be
salivated died: and unfortunately some who were evidently salivated died.
Since forming my table I find that a Mrs. Plummer who lived near the
wharf will die<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> Her case for the first seven days was supposed to be an
intermittent fever; then it assumed the symptoms of the yellow fever. She
was taken on the 11th July.</p>

“The bishop of Marseilles, during the time of this miserable calamity,
was indefatigable in the execution of his pastoral office, visiting, relieving,
encouraging and absolving the sick with extreme tenderness; and though
perpetually exposed to the infection, like Sir John Lawrence, the lord mayor
of London in 1665, was never seized with the disease&mdash;This last gentleman,
with undaunted resolution, continued in the city during the whole time of the
calamity, executing the duties of his office with the utmost punctuality.
The day after the disease was certainly known to be the plague, above
40,000 servants were dismissed, and turned into the streets to perish, for no
one would receive them into their houses: and the villages near London
drove them away with pitchforks and fire-arms. Sir John Lawrence
supported <i>them all</i>, as well the needy as those who were sick; at first by
expending his own fortune, till subscriptions could be solicited and
received from all parts of the nation.” (<i>Darwin’s Botanic Garden.
Loves of the Plants, canto</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 61.)</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
